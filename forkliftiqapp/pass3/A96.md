# Pass 3 Findings: A96

## File: LoginFragment.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `LoginFragment` (extends `FleetFragment`, implements `View.OnClickListener`)
- Full path: `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/fragment/LoginFragment.java`
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreateView` (line 33) — override of Fragment lifecycle method
  - `initViews` (line 38) — override of `FleetFragment.initViews()`; binds views, shows soft keyboard, sets version text, configures other-users button, attaches editor action listener
  - `onStop` (line 79) — override, delegates to `super.onStop()`
  - `onDestroy` (line 84) — override, delegates to `super.onDestroy()`
  - `onClick` (line 89) — implementation of `View.OnClickListener`; handles login button and other-users button
- Constants/Types: None defined
- Private Methods: `login()` (line 67)
- Notes: Line 98 contains a commented-out statement `//emails.add(0, "");` left in production code

### Findings

#### A96-1: `initViews()` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: LoginFragment.java, Line: 38
- Description: The public method `initViews()` has no Javadoc comment. It performs multiple non-trivial operations: finding and binding views for the username and password fields and login button, programmatically showing the soft keyboard focused on the password field, setting the version name text, conditionally disabling and dimming the other-users button when no stored emails exist, and attaching an IME action listener to trigger login on keyboard "Done". None of this behaviour is documented.

#### A96-2: `onClick()` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: LoginFragment.java, Line: 89
- Description: The public method `onClick(View view)` (implementing `View.OnClickListener`) has no Javadoc. It handles two distinct cases: the login button (invokes `login()`) and the other-users button (fetches stored emails from `UserDb` and presents a `ThemedSingleListDialog` to let the user select a previously used driver email). The conditional guard that skips the dialog when the email list is empty is undocumented.

#### A96-3: `onStop()` and `onDestroy()` have no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: LoginFragment.java, Lines: 79, 84
- Description: Both public lifecycle overrides have no Javadoc. They contain only a `super` delegation and no substantive logic, but their presence as explicit overrides (rather than relying on the inherited implementation) is unexplained. A brief note indicating why each override exists (even if only to satisfy a future hook point) would aid maintainability.

#### A96-4: Commented-out code left in `onClick()` [INFO]
- File: LoginFragment.java, Line: 98
- Description: The line `//emails.add(0, "");` is commented out inside the `onClick` handler for the other-users button. This is not a documentation defect in the strict Javadoc sense, but it is a documentation quality issue: there is no comment explaining why this line was removed or whether it should be restored. Stale commented-out code creates confusion for future maintainers.

## File: ProfileFragment.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `ProfileFragment` (extends `FleetFragment`, implements `View.OnClickListener`)
- Full path: `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/fragment/ProfileFragment.java`
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreateView` (line 34) — override of Fragment lifecycle method
  - `onActivityCreated` (line 40) — override; casts the host activity to `ProfileActivity` and stores a reference
  - `initViews` (line 59) — override of `FleetFragment.initViews()`; initialises bottom bar, binds name fields, loads user data, sets up edit/save buttons and resume/equipment links
  - `onLeftButton` (line 79) — override of `FleetFragment.onLeftButton()`; delegates to super
  - `onRightButton` (line 84) — override of `FleetFragment.onRightButton()`; delegates to super
  - `onResume` (line 89) — override, delegates to super
  - `onStop` (line 94) — override, delegates to super
  - `onDestroy` (line 99) — override, delegates to super
  - `onClick` (line 155) — implementation of `View.OnClickListener`; routes to edit mode, save, resume fragment, or equipment fragment
- Constants/Types: None defined
- Package-accessible fields: `activity` (line 28, `ProfileActivity`) — no access modifier (package-private)
- Private Methods: `setUserData()` (line 46), `saveModifiedResult()` (line 103), `updateUser()` (line 122), `onEnableEdit()` (line 147)

### Findings

#### A96-5: `initViews()` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: ProfileFragment.java, Line: 59
- Description: The public method `initViews()` has no Javadoc. It initialises the bottom navigation bar with specific icon/label arrays, binds the first-name and last-name `EditText` fields, calls `setUserData()` to populate them, sets up edit and save `LinearLayout` buttons (with save initially invisible), and attaches click listeners to "My Resume" and "My Equipments" views. The intent and side-effects of this method are entirely undocumented.

#### A96-6: `onActivityCreated()` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: ProfileFragment.java, Line: 40
- Description: The public override `onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState)` has no Javadoc. It performs an instanceof check to obtain a typed reference to the host `ProfileActivity`. This is a notable design pattern (fragment obtaining a typed activity reference) that warrants a comment explaining the assumption and what happens if the fragment is hosted in a non-`ProfileActivity` context (the reference silently remains null).

#### A96-7: `onClick()` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: ProfileFragment.java, Line: 155
- Description: The public method `onClick(View view)` has no Javadoc. It handles four distinct cases: enabling edit mode, saving profile changes (via `saveModifiedResult()`), navigating to `DriverStatsFragment1` ("My Resume"), and navigating to `ServiceRecordFragment` ("My Equipments"). The routing logic and its dependency on the `activity` field are undocumented.

#### A96-8: `onLeftButton()` and `onRightButton()` have no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: ProfileFragment.java, Lines: 79, 84
- Description: Both public overrides of `FleetFragment` bottom-bar callbacks have no Javadoc and contain only `super` delegations. Their presence as explicit overrides with no added behaviour is unexplained. Given that `FleetFragment.onLeftButton()` calls `getActivity().finish()` by default and `onRightButton()` is a no-op, a note clarifying why each is overridden would help distinguish intentional delegation from copy-paste placeholders.

#### A96-9: `onResume()`, `onStop()`, `onDestroy()` have no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: ProfileFragment.java, Lines: 89, 94, 99
- Description: Three public lifecycle overrides each contain only a `super` delegation and no Javadoc. Their explicit presence without any added logic or explanatory comment is a documentation gap.

#### A96-10: Package-private field `activity` lacks documentation [INFO]
- File: ProfileFragment.java, Line: 28
- Description: The field `ProfileActivity activity` has no access modifier (package-private) and no comment. It is populated conditionally in `onActivityCreated` and used in `onClick` to navigate sub-fragments. The rationale for storing the activity reference rather than using `getActivity()` with a cast at the point of use, and the risk of a null reference if the hosting activity is not a `ProfileActivity`, are undocumented.

## File: SavedReportFragment.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `SavedReportFragment` (extends `FleetFragment`)
- Full path: `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/fragment/SavedReportFragment.java`
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreateView` (line 28) — override of Fragment lifecycle method
  - `initViews` (line 33) — override of `FleetFragment.initViews()`; initialises bottom bar, creates and attaches `SavedReportListAdapter` to `ListView`, triggers data load
- Package-private Methods:
  - `onResend` (line 71) — called by `SavedReportListAdapter`; shows progress, calls `WebApi.async().resendReport()`, handles success/failure callbacks
- Private Methods:
  - `loadData()` (line 45)
  - `onData()` (line 65)
- Constants/Types: None defined
- Fields: `listAdapter` (line 23, private), `listData` (line 24, private, initialised to empty `ArrayList`)

### Findings

#### A96-11: `initViews()` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: SavedReportFragment.java, Line: 33
- Description: The public method `initViews()` has no Javadoc. It sets up the bottom navigation bar, instantiates `SavedReportListAdapter` with the fragment's `listData`, assigns a back-reference to the fragment on the adapter (`listAdapter.savedReportFragment = this`), attaches the adapter to the `ListView`, and triggers the initial network data load. The back-reference assignment to the adapter is a particularly noteworthy design decision that warrants documentation.

#### A96-12: `onResend()` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: SavedReportFragment.java, Line: 71
- Description: The package-private method `onResend(ReportItem reportItem)` has no Javadoc. Although not strictly public, it forms part of the inter-class API between `SavedReportFragment` and `SavedReportListAdapter` (the adapter holds a direct reference to the fragment and calls this method). The method shows a progress indicator, issues an async `resendReport` web request with the user ID and report ID, updates the progress message on success (auto-hiding after 1500 ms), and shows an error dialog on failure. None of this is documented.

## Cross-cutting Observation

All three fragments — `LoginFragment`, `ProfileFragment`, and `SavedReportFragment` — share a complete absence of Javadoc on every method, including both their own methods and their lifecycle/interface overrides. The parent class `FleetFragment` also has no Javadoc. This is a systemic documentation deficit across the UI fragment layer rather than isolated omissions. Individual findings above are reported as INFO because no Javadoc is inaccurate (there is none to be inaccurate), but the blanket absence of documentation increases onboarding cost and maintenance risk for the fragment layer as a whole.
