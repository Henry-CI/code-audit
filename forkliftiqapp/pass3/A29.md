# Pass 3 Findings: A29

## File: ProcessAndDisplayImageTask.java
**Full path:** `LibImageloader/src/main/java/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/ProcessAndDisplayImageTask.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `ProcessAndDisplayImageTask` (package-private `final class`, implements `Runnable`)
- Public Methods:
  - Constructor `ProcessAndDisplayImageTask(ImageLoaderEngine, Bitmap, ImageLoadingInfo, Handler)` (line 41)
  - `run()` (line 50) — from `Runnable`, annotated `@Override`
- Constants/Types:
  - `LOG_POSTPROCESS_IMAGE` — `private static final String` (line 34), log format string, not public API
- Class-level Javadoc: present (lines 25–31)

### Findings

#### A29-1: Constructor has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `ProcessAndDisplayImageTask.java`, Line: 41
- Description: The public constructor `ProcessAndDisplayImageTask(ImageLoaderEngine, Bitmap, ImageLoadingInfo, Handler)` has no Javadoc comment. None of its four parameters (`engine`, `bitmap`, `imageLoadingInfo`, `handler`) are described. Although the class is package-private and thus not exposed as public API, the constructor itself is declared `public`.

#### A29-2: `run()` method has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `ProcessAndDisplayImageTask.java`, Line: 50
- Description: The `run()` method (fulfilling the `Runnable` contract) has no Javadoc. It performs post-processing of the bitmap via `BitmapProcessor`, wraps the result in a `DisplayBitmapTask`, and dispatches it — none of which is described in a method-level comment. The class-level Javadoc provides a brief description of overall purpose but does not substitute for method documentation.

## File: ContentLengthInputStream.java
**Full path:** `LibImageloader/src/main/java/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/assist/ContentLengthInputStream.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `ContentLengthInputStream` (public, extends `java.io.InputStream`)
- Public Methods:
  - Constructor `ContentLengthInputStream(InputStream stream, int length)` (line 33)
  - `available()` (line 39) — `@Override`
  - `close()` (line 44) — `@Override`
  - `mark(int readLimit)` (line 49) — `@Override`
  - `read()` (line 54) — `@Override`
  - `read(byte[] buffer)` (line 59) — `@Override`
  - `read(byte[] buffer, int byteOffset, int byteCount)` (line 64) — `@Override`
  - `reset()` (line 69) — `@Override`
  - `skip(long byteCount)` (line 74) — `@Override`
  - `markSupported()` (line 79) — `@Override`
- Constants/Types: None
- Class-level Javadoc: present (lines 21–27)

### Findings

#### A29-3: Constructor has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `ContentLengthInputStream.java`, Line: 33
- Description: The public constructor `ContentLengthInputStream(InputStream stream, int length)` has no Javadoc. Neither the `stream` nor the `length` parameter is described. Since `length` is stored and unconditionally returned by `available()` regardless of read progress, documenting the expected meaning of `length` (e.g., the full content-length of the underlying stream as provided by HTTP headers) would be important for correct usage.

#### A29-4: `available()` override semantics not documented at method level [INFO]
- File: `ContentLengthInputStream.java`, Line: 39
- Description: `available()` deviates from the standard `InputStream.available()` contract: it always returns the fixed `length` supplied at construction rather than an estimate of bytes remaining unread. The class-level Javadoc does mention this behaviour, but there is no method-level Javadoc on `available()` itself to make the deviation immediately visible to a reader inspecting the method in isolation or via IDE hover documentation.

#### A29-5: All other overridden public methods lack Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `ContentLengthInputStream.java`, Lines: 44, 49, 54, 59, 64, 69, 74, 79
- Description: The following eight overridden public methods have no Javadoc comments: `close()`, `mark(int)`, `read()`, `read(byte[])`, `read(byte[], int, int)`, `reset()`, `skip(long)`, `markSupported()`. All delegate transparently to the wrapped `stream` instance. While the delegation pattern is straightforward, the absence of any method-level documentation means there is no indication that the behaviour is entirely delegated, nor any `@inheritDoc` tag to pull parent documentation into generated Javadoc output.

## File: FailReason.java
**Full path:** `LibImageloader/src/main/java/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/assist/FailReason.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `FailReason` (public)
- Public Methods:
  - Constructor `FailReason(FailType type, Throwable cause)` (line 30)
  - `getType()` (line 36)
  - `getCause()` (line 40)
- Constants/Types:
  - `FailType` — `public static enum` (line 46)
    - `IO_ERROR` (line 48) — with Javadoc
    - `DECODING_ERROR` (line 54) — with Javadoc
    - `NETWORK_DENIED` (line 56) — with Javadoc
    - `OUT_OF_MEMORY` (line 61) — with Javadoc
    - `UNKNOWN` (line 63) — with Javadoc
- Class-level Javadoc: present (lines 18–23)
- `getType()` Javadoc: present, accurate (line 35)
- `getCause()` Javadoc: present, accurate (line 40)
- All `FailType` enum constants: Javadoc present and accurate

### Findings

#### A29-6: Constructor has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `FailReason.java`, Line: 30
- Description: The public constructor `FailReason(FailType type, Throwable cause)` has no Javadoc comment. Neither parameter is described. In particular, the semantics of `cause` being nullable (consistent with what `getCause()` documents: "can be null") are not stated at the point of construction, which could lead a caller to assume non-null is required.
