# Pass 3 Findings: A86

## File: DriverStatsActivity.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/DriverStatsActivity.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `DriverStatsActivity` extends `FleetActivity` (line 8)
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)` (line 10) — `@Override`, declared `protected` (not public)
- Constants/Types: None defined

### Findings

#### A86-1: No Javadoc on `onCreate` override [INFO]
- File: `DriverStatsActivity.java`, Line: 10
- Description: The `onCreate` method has no Javadoc comment. It overrides `Activity.onCreate`, sets the content view to `activity_common`, calls `initKeyboard()`, and loads `DriverStatsFragment1` into the fragment container without a back-stack entry. The behaviour (particularly the `initKeyboard()` call and the specific fragment used) is non-trivial and would benefit from a brief comment explaining the screen's purpose and setup steps.

## File: DriversActivity.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/DriversActivity.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `DriversActivity` extends `FleetActivity` (line 10)
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)` (line 13) — `@Override`, declared `protected` (not public)
- Constants/Types: None defined
- Unused import: `au.com.collectiveintelligence.fleetiq360.ui.fragment.EquipmentListFragment` (line 8) — imported but never referenced in this file

### Findings

#### A86-2: No Javadoc on `onCreate` override [INFO]
- File: `DriversActivity.java`, Line: 13
- Description: The `onCreate` method has no Javadoc comment. It sets the content view to `activity_drivers` and loads `DriverListFragment` into the fragment container without a back-stack entry. No documentation exists to explain the activity's role or setup.

#### A86-3: Unused import `EquipmentListFragment` [INFO]
- File: `DriversActivity.java`, Line: 8
- Description: `au.com.collectiveintelligence.fleetiq360.ui.fragment.EquipmentListFragment` is imported but is not referenced anywhere in the file. This is a stale import, likely left over from copy-paste or a refactor. While not a documentation issue per se, it misleads a reader into thinking equipment functionality is present in this activity. A comment clarifying the activity's sole responsibility (displaying the driver list) would help, as would removing the dead import.

## File: EquipmentActivity.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/EquipmentActivity.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `EquipmentActivity` extends `FleetActivity` (line 12)
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)` (line 15) — `@Override`, declared `protected` (not public)
- Constants/Types: None defined
- Notable side-effect: `TakePhotoPathPrefs.clearImages()` is called during `onCreate` (line 20)

### Findings

#### A86-4: No Javadoc on `onCreate` override — undocumented side-effect [INFO]
- File: `EquipmentActivity.java`, Line: 15
- Description: The `onCreate` method has no Javadoc comment. In addition to the standard pattern of setting a content view and loading a fragment (`EquipmentListFragment`), it calls `TakePhotoPathPrefs.clearImages()` (line 20), which clears persisted photo path state. This is a stateful, destructive side-effect that is entirely undocumented. A reader maintaining this class has no indication why image paths are cleared on activity creation, whether this is intentional for every entry into the equipment screen, or whether it is correct to clear them before the fragment has had a chance to read them. This side-effect warrants at minimum an inline comment and ideally a class-level or method-level Javadoc explaining the lifecycle intent.
