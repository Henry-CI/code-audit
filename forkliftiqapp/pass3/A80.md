# Pass 3 Findings: A80

## File: RealmInt.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `RealmInt` (extends `io.realm.RealmObject`)
- Public Methods: none
- Fields: `int data` (package-private, line 9)
- Constants/Types: none
- Class-level comment (lines 5-7): IDE-generated creation note only (`Created by steveyang on 1/10/16.`), not a Javadoc describing purpose

### Findings

#### A80-1: Class `RealmInt` has no meaningful Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `RealmInt.java`, Line: 5
- Description: The only comment on the class is the IDE-generated `Created by steveyang on 1/10/16.` stub. There is no Javadoc explaining the purpose of the class (a Realm-compatible wrapper for a primitive `int` value). The class has no public methods to document individually, but the class itself is part of the public API and is undocumented.

## File: RealmString.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `RealmString` (extends `io.realm.RealmObject`)
- Public Methods: none
- Fields: `String data` (package-private, line 9)
- Constants/Types: none
- Class-level comment (lines 5-7): IDE-generated creation note only (`Created by steveyang on 1/10/16.`), not a Javadoc describing purpose

### Findings

#### A80-2: Class `RealmString` has no meaningful Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `RealmString.java`, Line: 5
- Description: Same issue as `RealmInt`. The only comment is the IDE-generated creation stub. No Javadoc explains that this class is a Realm-compatible wrapper around a `String` value. The class is part of the public API and is undocumented.

## File: SafeRealm.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `SafeRealm` (no superclass, no class-level Javadoc)
- Public Methods:
  - `Execute(SafeRealm.Action action)` — static, void (line 7)
  - `executeTransaction(SafeRealm.Action action)` — static, void (line 13)
  - `Execute(SafeRealm.Func<T> func)` — static, generic return `T` (line 24)
- Public Interfaces defined:
  - `Action` (line 31): single method `void Execute(Realm realm)`
  - `Func<T>` (line 35): single method `T Execute(Realm realm)`
- Constants/Types: none

### Findings

#### A80-3: Class `SafeRealm` has no class-level Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `SafeRealm.java`, Line: 6
- Description: The class has no Javadoc comment at all. Its purpose — providing static helper methods that acquire a Realm instance, delegate to a caller-supplied callback, and guarantee `realm.close()` is called — is not documented anywhere. Readers must infer the contract entirely from the implementation.

#### A80-4: `Execute(SafeRealm.Action)` is undocumented [INFO]
- File: `SafeRealm.java`, Line: 7
- Description: No Javadoc exists for this public static method. The method obtains the default Realm instance, invokes `action.Execute(realm)`, then closes the instance. There is no documentation of the parameter, the behavior guarantee (realm is always closed), or any exceptions that may propagate from the action.

#### A80-5: `executeTransaction(SafeRealm.Action)` is undocumented [INFO]
- File: `SafeRealm.java`, Line: 13
- Description: No Javadoc exists for this public static method. The method obtains the default Realm instance, wraps the action inside a `Realm.Transaction`, executes it via `realm.executeTransaction(...)`, then closes the realm. There is no documentation of the transactional semantics, auto-commit/rollback behavior inherited from Realm, the parameter contract, or the fact that the realm is closed after execution.

#### A80-6: `Execute(SafeRealm.Func<T>)` is undocumented [INFO]
- File: `SafeRealm.java`, Line: 24
- Description: No Javadoc exists for this public static generic method. The method obtains the default Realm instance, invokes `func.Execute(realm)` to produce a result, closes the realm, and returns the result. There is no documentation of the type parameter `T`, the parameter, the return value, or the important caveat that the returned object must not be a live Realm-managed object (since the realm is closed before returning, accessing a managed object after this call would throw an exception in Realm).

#### A80-7: Public interface `Action` is undocumented [INFO]
- File: `SafeRealm.java`, Line: 31
- Description: The `Action` functional interface and its single method `Execute(Realm realm)` have no Javadoc. The contract — that implementations receive an open, valid Realm instance and should not close it themselves — is not stated anywhere.

#### A80-8: Public interface `Func<T>` is undocumented [INFO]
- File: `SafeRealm.java`, Line: 35
- Description: The `Func<T>` functional interface and its single method `Execute(Realm realm)` have no Javadoc. The same missing contract as `Action` applies, plus the critical undocumented constraint that the returned value `T` must not be a live Realm-managed object, because the calling method (`Execute(Func<T>)`) closes the Realm before the caller can use the return value. Violation of this constraint causes a runtime crash (closed Realm access), making this the highest-risk undocumented point in these three files.

#### A80-9: Inconsistent method naming convention in `SafeRealm` [INFO]
- File: `SafeRealm.java`, Lines: 7, 13, 24
- Description: Two of the three public static methods are named `Execute` (PascalCase), while the third is named `executeTransaction` (camelCase). Java conventions require camelCase for method names. The inconsistency is not documented or explained. While this is primarily a code style issue, the absence of any documentation means callers have no guidance on which convention is intentional, and it increases the chance of incorrect usage or confusion when reading call sites.
