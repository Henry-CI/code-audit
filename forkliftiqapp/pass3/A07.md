# Pass 3 Findings: A07

## File: IDialogGenericCallback.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `IDialogGenericCallback` (interface)
- Public Methods: `callBack` (line 10)
- Constants/Types: none

### Findings

#### A07-1: `callBack` method has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/IDialogGenericCallback.java`, Line: 10
- Description: The interface's single method `callBack()` has no Javadoc comment. There is a file-level block comment naming the author and creation date (lines 3–7), but it is attached to the interface declaration, not to the method. No description of the method's purpose, expected caller contract, or thread-safety assumptions is present.

## File: LibConfig.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `LibConfig`
- Public Methods: none (no methods declared)
- Constants/Types:
  - `public static final String BASE_DIRECTOY = "ForkIQ360"` (line 8)
  - `public static final String IMAGE_DIRECTORY = "images"` (line 9)

### Findings

#### A07-2: `BASE_DIRECTOY` constant name contains a typo [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/LibConfig.java`, Line: 8
- Description: The constant is named `BASE_DIRECTOY` (missing the second 'R' in "DIRECTORY"). This is a documentation/naming issue: any developer reading the public API or using autocomplete will encounter the misspelled identifier. No Javadoc is present on either constant to clarify the intended use, the platform root location this path refers to, or why the value is `"ForkIQ360"` rather than a value derived from build configuration.

#### A07-3: Class and constants have no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/LibConfig.java`, Lines: 3–10
- Description: The class-level comment is a bare `Created by` attribution only. Neither `BASE_DIRECTOY` nor `IMAGE_DIRECTORY` has a Javadoc comment explaining what file-system paths they represent, how they are combined, or which permissions are required for the directories they name.

## File: NotesDialog.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `NotesDialog extends BaseDialog`
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle)` (line 32) — override
  - `newInstance(String title, String hint, String content, Callback callback)` (line 40) — static factory
  - `setAcceptText(String string)` (line 63)
  - `setupViews()` (line 69) — override (`protected`, not public — noted for completeness)
- Constants/Types:
  - Inner interface `Callback` (line 117) with method `callback(String notes)` (line 118)

### Findings

#### A07-4: `onCreateView` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/NotesDialog.java`, Line: 32
- Description: The public override of `onCreateView` has no Javadoc. There is no explanation of the layout resource inflated (`R.layout.notes_dialog`), the `Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE` request made inside this lifecycle method (which is an unusual placement — it is normally done before `setContentView` / in `onCreateDialog`), or any parameter semantics.

#### A07-5: `newInstance` static factory has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/NotesDialog.java`, Line: 40
- Description: The public static factory method `newInstance` has no Javadoc. Callers have no documented guidance on:
  - Which parameters are nullable (the implementation silently ignores `null` for `title`, `hint`, `content`, and `callback`, but passing a `null` callback will cause a `NullPointerException` at save-button click time — line 104 — because the null check only skips assignment, leaving `mCallback` as `null`).
  - The expected content of `title`, `hint`, and `content`.
  - The threading requirement (must be called on the main thread before the fragment is attached).

#### A07-6: `newInstance` null-callback guard is misleading and dangerous — no documentation warning [MEDIUM]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/NotesDialog.java`, Lines: 52–54 and 104
- Description: The guard `if (callback != null) { fragment.mCallback = callback; }` (line 52) implies that passing `null` is a safe, handled case. However, `mCallback` is never initialised to a non-null default, so if `callback` is `null` the field remains `null`. When the user taps Save, line 104 (`mCallback.callback(...)`) throws a `NullPointerException`. This is a behavioural defect, but in the context of Pass 3 the finding is that there is no `@throws NullPointerException` or `@param` note warning callers that a null callback will crash at runtime. The absence of documentation means the misleading guard will not be caught in code review.

#### A07-7: `setAcceptText` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/NotesDialog.java`, Line: 63
- Description: `setAcceptText(String string)` has no Javadoc. The method name implies it sets the label of an accept/confirm button, but its relationship to `mSaveButton` (the internal field name) is not stated. There is also no documented constraint on when this method must be called relative to dialog display (it must be called before `setupViews()` executes, otherwise the button text is not updated).

#### A07-8: Inner interface `Callback` and its method have no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/NotesDialog.java`, Lines: 117–119
- Description: The public inner interface `Callback` and its sole method `callback(String notes)` have no Javadoc. The parameter name `notes` is not documented; neither is the threading context (the method is invoked on the main thread from a button click listener) nor the guarantee about the string value (it is always non-null, derived from `EditText.getText().toString()`).

#### A07-9: File-level comment is not a Javadoc comment [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/NotesDialog.java`, Lines: 12–16
- Description: The block comment above the class declaration uses `/* ... */` rather than `/** ... */`, so it is not parsed as Javadoc and will not appear in generated API documentation. The same pattern is present in `IDialogGenericCallback.java` (lines 3–7). As a result, `javadoc` tooling produces no class-level documentation for these types.
