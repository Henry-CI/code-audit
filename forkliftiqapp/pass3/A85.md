# Pass 3 Findings: A85

## File: ActionActivity.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `ActionActivity` (extends `FleetActivity`)
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreate` (line 12) — overrides `Activity.onCreate`; package-visible via `@Override`, effectively `protected`
- Constants/Types: None defined

### Findings

#### A85-1: `onCreate` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/ActionActivity.java`, Line: 12
- Description: The overridden `onCreate` method has no Javadoc comment. The method reads the `"action"` Intent extra and conditionally shows either `SetupEmailFragment` (when action equals `"setup"`) or `SavedReportFragment` (when action equals `"report"`). Neither the branching logic, the expected Intent extra name/values, nor the NullPointerException risk (if the `"action"` extra is absent, `action.equals(...)` will throw NPE at line 19) are documented anywhere in the class.

#### A85-2: No class-level Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/ActionActivity.java`, Line: 10
- Description: The class `ActionActivity` has no class-level Javadoc. There is no description of its purpose, the mandatory `"action"` Intent extra it requires, or the valid values (`"setup"`, `"report"`) that callers must supply.

## File: ActionClearActivity.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `ActionClearActivity` (extends `FleetActivity`)
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreate` (line 11) — overrides `Activity.onCreate`; protected
- Constants/Types: None defined

### Findings

#### A85-3: `onCreate` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/ActionClearActivity.java`, Line: 11
- Description: The overridden `onCreate` method has no Javadoc comment. The method reads the `"action"` Intent extra and shows `SetupEmailFragment` only when the value equals `"setup"`. The NullPointerException risk (line 18: `action.equals("setup")` will throw NPE if the `"action"` extra is absent) and the silent no-op for any unrecognised action value are not documented.

#### A85-4: No class-level Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/ActionClearActivity.java`, Line: 9
- Description: The class `ActionClearActivity` has no class-level Javadoc. Its relationship to `ActionActivity` (appears to be a variant that handles only the `"setup"` action and omits the `"report"` branch) and the required Intent contract are undocumented.

## File: DashboardActivity.java
### Reading Evidence
- Class: `DashboardActivity` (extends `FleetActivity`)
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreate` (line 14) — overrides `Activity.onCreate`; protected
  - `onResume` (line 22) — overrides `Activity.onResume`; protected
- Constants/Types: None defined

### Findings

#### A85-5: `onCreate` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/DashboardActivity.java`, Line: 14
- Description: The overridden `onCreate` method has no Javadoc comment. It sets the content view to `activity_dashboard` and loads `DashboardFragment` into the fragment container. No documentation exists for this behaviour.

#### A85-6: `onResume` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/DashboardActivity.java`, Line: 22
- Description: The overridden `onResume` method has no Javadoc comment. It schedules a 2000 ms delayed runnable (via `MyApplication.runLater`) that starts three background services: `ShockEventService`, `CacheService`, and `SyncService`. The deliberate 2-second delay and the rationale for starting these particular services on every resume are undocumented.

#### A85-7: No class-level Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/DashboardActivity.java`, Line: 12
- Description: The class `DashboardActivity` has no class-level Javadoc. Its role as the main dashboard entry point and its responsibility for orchestrating background service startup on resume are not described anywhere in the source file.
