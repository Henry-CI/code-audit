# Pass 3 Findings: A88

## File: LoginActivity.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/LoginActivity.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `LoginActivity` (extends `FleetActivity`)
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)` — line 14 (overrides `AppCompatActivity`/`FleetActivity`; access modifier is `protected`, not `public`)
- Constants/Types: None defined in this file

### Findings

#### A88-1: No class-level Javadoc on LoginActivity [INFO]
- File: `LoginActivity.java`, Line: 12
- Description: The class `LoginActivity` has no Javadoc comment. The class performs non-trivial routing logic on startup: if a `CurrentUser` is present it redirects to either `DriversActivity` (when the user has associated drivers) or `DashboardActivity` (when not), then calls `finish()`; otherwise it shows `LoginFragment`. This behaviour is undocumented at the class level.

#### A88-2: No Javadoc on overridden `onCreate` in LoginActivity [INFO]
- File: `LoginActivity.java`, Line: 14
- Description: The `onCreate` method contains conditional navigation logic (redirect to `DriversActivity` or `DashboardActivity` if a current user already exists, otherwise show `LoginFragment`) with no Javadoc explaining the purpose or the branching conditions. Because the method is `protected` and `@Override`, a doc comment describing the routing behaviour would assist maintainers.

## File: ProfileActivity.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/ProfileActivity.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `ProfileActivity` (extends `FleetActivity`)
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)` — line 11 (access modifier is `protected`; `@Override`)
- Constants/Types: None defined in this file

### Findings

#### A88-3: No class-level Javadoc on ProfileActivity [INFO]
- File: `ProfileActivity.java`, Line: 9
- Description: The class `ProfileActivity` has no Javadoc comment. There is no documentation indicating its purpose (hosting `ProfileFragment` inside `activity_profile` layout).

#### A88-4: No Javadoc on overridden `onCreate` in ProfileActivity [INFO]
- File: `ProfileActivity.java`, Line: 11
- Description: The `onCreate` method has no Javadoc. While the implementation is simple, the absence of documentation is consistent with the pattern found throughout these files and is noted for completeness.

## File: SessionActivity.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/SessionActivity.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `SessionActivity` (extends `FleetActivity`)
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)` — line 24 (access modifier is `protected`; `@Override`)
  - `onBackPressed()` — line 76 (access modifier is `public`; `@Override`)
  - `onExitSessionActivity()` — line 90 (public, not annotated)
  - `abortSession(SessionResult sessionResult)` — line 118 (public, not annotated)
- Constants/Types: None defined in this file (relies on `MyCommonValue`, `SessionDb`, `WebData`, `BleController`, `YesNoDialog`, and `FleetActivity`-inherited members)

### Findings

#### A88-5: No class-level Javadoc on SessionActivity [INFO]
- File: `SessionActivity.java`, Line: 22
- Description: `SessionActivity` has no class-level Javadoc. The class orchestrates significant session lifecycle concerns: it keeps the screen on (`FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`), reads a running session from the database, decides whether to show `EquipmentConnectFragment`, `EquipmentPrestartFragment`, or `JobsFragment`, and provides abort/exit paths. None of this is documented.

#### A88-6: No Javadoc on overridden `onCreate` in SessionActivity [INFO]
- File: `SessionActivity.java`, Line: 24
- Description: The `onCreate` method contains complex conditional routing: it exits immediately if no running session or `SessionDb` record exists; it exits early (with a silent `return`) if `currentEquipmentItem` is null after attempting to populate it from the database; it then branches on BLE MAC address validity, device setup state, and equipment setup state to show either `EquipmentConnectFragment` (with `autoConnect = true`) or runs a pre-start/job check. This non-trivial logic has no Javadoc.

#### A88-7: No Javadoc on overridden `onBackPressed` [INFO]
- File: `SessionActivity.java`, Line: 76
- Description: `onBackPressed` overrides the default back-press behaviour. When the visible fragment is `EquipmentPrestartFragment` or `EquipmentConnectFragment`, it calls `onExitSessionActivity()` instead of the standard back stack pop. Otherwise it delegates to `super.onBackPressed()`. This custom routing is undocumented.

#### A88-8: No Javadoc on public method `onExitSessionActivity` [INFO]
- File: `SessionActivity.java`, Line: 90
- Description: `onExitSessionActivity()` is a public method with no Javadoc. It displays a confirmation dialog ("WARNING!" with proceed/cancel options); on confirmation it clears `FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`, retrieves the current `SessionResult` from `WebData`, and calls `abortSession`. The method is called both from `onBackPressed` and is accessible to other components, making documentation particularly useful.

#### A88-9: No Javadoc on public method `abortSession` [INFO]
- File: `SessionActivity.java`, Line: 118
- Description: `abortSession(SessionResult sessionResult)` is a public method with no Javadoc. It: (1) guards against a null argument by returning immediately; (2) shows a progress dialog; (3) delegates to `abortSessionWithCallback` with an inline callback that on success updates progress text, hides the progress dialog after 800 ms, calls `finish()`, and sets `connectingDevice = false`; on failure it shows a retry/exit dialog that can recursively call `abortSession` again. The parameter, return behaviour, retry logic, and side-effects (`connectingDevice` mutation, `finish()`) are all undocumented.

#### A88-10: Silent early-return in `onCreate` may mask equipment-item loading failure [LOW]
- File: `SessionActivity.java`, Line: 37-40
- Description: When `MyCommonValue.currentEquipmentItem` is null, the code attempts to populate it via `SessionDb.readRunningEquipmentItem()` and then immediately returns without displaying any fragment or error to the user. The screen will be blank and the activity remains open but non-functional. No comment or documentation explains that this is an intentional guard, a deferred-load pattern, or that something external is expected to restart `onCreate`. A misleading or missing doc note here creates a maintenance risk: developers may not understand whether this is a bug or by design.
