# Pass 3 Findings: A55

## File: FuelTypeItem.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/WebService/webserviceclasses/FuelTypeItem.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `FuelTypeItem` (implements `Serializable`)
- Public Fields: `id` (int, line 14), `name` (String, line 15)
- Public Methods:
  - `FuelTypeItem()` — no-arg constructor (line 17)
  - `FuelTypeItem(JSONObject jsonObject)` — parameterised constructor (line 20), throws `JSONException`
- Constants/Types: None defined

### Findings

#### A55-1: No class-level Javadoc on FuelTypeItem [INFO]
- File: FuelTypeItem.java, Line: 12
- Description: The class `FuelTypeItem` has no Javadoc comment. There is no description of its purpose (representing a fuel type record returned from a web service), its fields, or its serialization contract.

#### A55-2: No-arg constructor `FuelTypeItem()` is undocumented [INFO]
- File: FuelTypeItem.java, Line: 17
- Description: The default no-arg constructor has no Javadoc. Its intended use (e.g., for deserialization or manual field assignment) is not stated.

#### A55-3: Parameterised constructor `FuelTypeItem(JSONObject)` is undocumented [INFO]
- File: FuelTypeItem.java, Line: 20
- Description: The constructor that parses a `JSONObject` has no Javadoc. There is no documentation of the `jsonObject` parameter, the expected JSON keys (`"id"`, `"name"`), the behaviour when `jsonObject` is `null` (silent no-op — all fields remain at default values), or the declared `JSONException` that is thrown when a key is present but cannot be parsed as the expected type.

## File: LoginItem.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/WebService/webserviceclasses/LoginItem.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `LoginItem` (implements `Serializable`)
- Public Fields:
  - `id` (int, line 15)
  - `comp_id` (int, line 16)
  - `first_name` (String, line 17)
  - `last_name` (String, line 18)
  - `email` (String, line 19)
  - `password` (String, line 20)
  - `phone` (String, line 21)
  - `licno` (String, line 22)
  - `expirydt` (String, line 23)
  - `addr` (String, line 24)
  - `securityno` (String, line 25)
  - `photo_url` (String, line 26)
  - `contactperson` (boolean, line 27)
  - `date_format` (String, line 28)
  - `max_session_length` (int, line 29)
  - `compliance_date` (String, line 30)
  - `gps_frequency` (int, line 31)
  - `drivers` (List\<LoginItem\>, line 33)
  - `arrDriverTrainings` (List\<TrainingItem\>, line 34)
- Public Methods:
  - `LoginItem(JSONObject jsonObject)` — sole constructor (line 36), throws `JSONException`
- Constants/Types: None defined

### Findings

#### A55-4: No class-level Javadoc on LoginItem [INFO]
- File: LoginItem.java, Line: 14
- Description: The class `LoginItem` has no Javadoc. The class is responsible for representing a user/login record from the web service and contains sensitive fields (`password`, `securityno`, `licno`). None of its purpose, field semantics, or security considerations are documented.

#### A55-5: Constructor `LoginItem(JSONObject)` is undocumented [INFO]
- File: LoginItem.java, Line: 36
- Description: The sole constructor has no Javadoc. The following behaviours are entirely undocumented:
  - The `jsonObject` parameter and the full set of expected JSON keys.
  - The early-return behaviour when `jsonObject` is `null` (line 37–38): fields are left at Java defaults rather than throwing an exception.
  - The conditional population of `drivers` (lines 69–76): the `drivers` list is only populated when `contactperson` is `true`; when `false`, it silently remains an empty list.
  - The conditional population of `arrDriverTrainings` (lines 60–67): guards against a null JSON key, but the `drivers` array uses `JSONObjectParser.getJSONArray` which may apply different null-handling — the asymmetry is not documented.
  - The declared `JSONException`.

#### A55-6: Sensitive field `password` stored in plain text with no documentation warning [INFO]
- File: LoginItem.java, Line: 20
- Description: The public field `password` is populated directly from the JSON response (line 48) and stored as a plain `String` with no access control (public field) and no Javadoc warning about its sensitivity. While this is primarily a security design concern, from a documentation standpoint the field carries no annotation or comment indicating how it should be handled by callers, increasing the risk of accidental logging or exposure.

## File: ManufactureItem.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/WebService/webserviceclasses/ManufactureItem.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `ManufactureItem` (implements `Serializable`)
- Public Fields: `id` (int, line 14), `name` (String, line 15)
- Public Methods:
  - `ManufactureItem()` — no-arg constructor (line 17)
  - `ManufactureItem(JSONObject jsonObject)` — parameterised constructor (line 20), throws `JSONException`
- Constants/Types: None defined

### Findings

#### A55-7: No class-level Javadoc on ManufactureItem [INFO]
- File: ManufactureItem.java, Line: 12
- Description: The class `ManufactureItem` has no Javadoc comment. There is no description of its purpose (representing a forklift manufacturer record returned from a web service), its fields, or its serialization contract.

#### A55-8: No-arg constructor `ManufactureItem()` is undocumented [INFO]
- File: ManufactureItem.java, Line: 17
- Description: The default no-arg constructor has no Javadoc. Its intended use (e.g., for deserialization or manual field assignment) is not stated.

#### A55-9: Parameterised constructor `ManufactureItem(JSONObject)` is undocumented [INFO]
- File: ManufactureItem.java, Line: 20
- Description: The constructor that parses a `JSONObject` has no Javadoc. There is no documentation of the `jsonObject` parameter, the expected JSON keys (`"id"`, `"name"`), the behaviour when `jsonObject` is `null` (silent no-op — all fields remain at default values), or the declared `JSONException` that is thrown when a key is present but cannot be parsed as the expected type.

#### A55-10: ManufactureItem is structurally identical to FuelTypeItem with no documentation distinguishing the two [INFO]
- File: ManufactureItem.java, Line: 12
- Description: `ManufactureItem` and `FuelTypeItem` share identical field names (`id`, `name`), identical constructor signatures, and identical JSON-parsing logic. The absence of any class-level or constructor-level Javadoc makes it impossible for a reader to understand the domain distinction between the two types without tracing call sites. Documentation should clarify what entity each class represents and why both exist as separate types.
