# Pass 3 Findings: A11

## File: LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/WebService/GsonHelper.java

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `GsonHelper` (line 12) — top-level public class, no Javadoc
- Public Methods:
  - `objectFromString(String data, Class<T> dataClass)` (line 13) — static generic method
  - `fromObject(Object object)` (line 30) — static method returning `JSONObject`
  - `stringFromObjectNoPolicy(Object object)` (line 43) — static method returning `String`
- Private Methods (not subject to public-doc requirements, noted for completeness):
  - `fromObjectNoNamePolicy(Object object)` (line 17) — private static
- Constants/Types: None defined

### Findings

#### A11-1: `GsonHelper` class has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/WebService/GsonHelper.java`, Line: 12
- Description: The public class `GsonHelper` has no class-level Javadoc comment. The purpose of the class (a utility providing Gson-based serialization/deserialization helpers) is not described anywhere in the source.

#### A11-2: `objectFromString` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/WebService/GsonHelper.java`, Line: 13
- Description: The public static method `objectFromString(String data, Class<T> dataClass)` has no Javadoc. There is no documentation for the parameters, return value, or behavior when `data` is null or malformed JSON (Gson will return null or throw a `JsonSyntaxException` in those cases respectively).

#### A11-3: `fromObject` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/WebService/GsonHelper.java`, Line: 30
- Description: The public static method `fromObject(Object object)` has no Javadoc. Notably, the method applies `FieldNamingPolicy.UPPER_CAMEL_CASE` to field names during serialization — a non-obvious behaviour that directly affects the shape of the resulting `JSONObject`. This policy is also not documented. The method returns `null` on `JSONException`; that return contract is undocumented.

#### A11-4: `stringFromObjectNoPolicy` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/WebService/GsonHelper.java`, Line: 43
- Description: The public static method `stringFromObjectNoPolicy(Object object)` has no Javadoc. The method name implies "no naming policy", but the behaviour that distinguishes it from `fromObject` (i.e., no `UPPER_CAMEL_CASE` field renaming) is not described. The method silently returns an empty string `""` when serialization fails or the intermediate `JSONObject` is null; this silent-failure contract is undocumented.

## File: LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/YesNoDialog.java

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `YesNoDialog extends BaseDialog` (line 18) — public class, extends `BaseDialog` (which extends `DialogFragment`)
- Class-level Javadoc: Present at lines 13–17, but contains only author and date; no description of class purpose.
- Public Methods:
  - `onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState)` (line 36) — `@Override`
  - `newInstance(String title, String content, String buttonAcceptText, String buttonDeclineText, int timeoutInSeconds, Callback callback)` (line 45) — static factory
  - `onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState)` (line 88) — `@Override`
  - `init()` (line 95)
- Private Methods (noted for completeness):
  - `setInitialValues()` (line 107)
  - `setListeners()` (line 134)
- Nested Types:
  - `Callback` interface (line 159) — public interface with three methods:
    - `onAcceptPress()` (line 161)
    - `onDeclinePress()` (line 163)
    - `onTimeOutDialog()` (line 165)
- Fields: `countDownTimer` is `private static` (line 31) — a static field on a `DialogFragment` subclass; not documented.
- Constants/Types: None (no `static final` constants)

### Findings

#### A11-5: Class-level Javadoc is content-free [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/YesNoDialog.java`, Lines: 13–17
- Description: The class-level comment block contains only `Created by michael.carr on 29/08/2014` — no description of what `YesNoDialog` is, what it renders, or how callers should use it. While the comment is present, it provides no useful documentation.

#### A11-6: `newInstance` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/YesNoDialog.java`, Line: 45
- Description: The public static factory method `newInstance(...)` has no Javadoc. This is the primary API entry point for constructing a `YesNoDialog`. Important behaviours that are undocumented include: (a) `null` values for `title`, `content`, `buttonAcceptText`, and `buttonDeclineText` are silently ignored and fall back to defaults or empty strings; (b) `timeoutInSeconds <= 0` disables the countdown entirely; (c) if `callback` is `null`, no timer is started and button clicks will throw a `NullPointerException` at runtime because `mCallback` is never null-guarded in `setListeners`; (d) the `countDownTimer` field is `static`, meaning a second call to `newInstance` while a prior dialog is still visible will replace and orphan the previous timer.

#### A11-7: `newInstance` — static `countDownTimer` field creates a shared-state hazard, undocumented [LOW]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/YesNoDialog.java`, Line: 31
- Description: `countDownTimer` is declared `private static`, making it shared across all instances of `YesNoDialog`. If two dialogs are created concurrently, the second call to `newInstance` silently overwrites the static reference without cancelling the first timer, causing the first timer to fire an orphaned `onTimeOutDialog` callback on the wrong (or already-dismissed) fragment. This architectural risk is entirely undocumented. Given `YesNoDialog` is a `DialogFragment` (an inherently instance-scoped construct), this static field is a documentation gap that rises to LOW because it can mislead future maintainers into thinking the class is safe for concurrent use.

#### A11-8: `init` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/YesNoDialog.java`, Line: 95
- Description: The public method `init()` has no Javadoc. Its purpose (sizing the dialog window and binding view references from the inflated layout) and its preconditions (must be called after the view hierarchy is available) are not described.

#### A11-9: `Callback` interface and its methods have no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/YesNoDialog.java`, Lines: 159–167
- Description: The public nested interface `Callback` and all three of its methods (`onAcceptPress`, `onDeclinePress`, `onTimeOutDialog`) have no Javadoc. Callers implementing this interface are given no guidance on threading (callbacks are issued on the main thread), whether `dismiss()` has already been called before the callback fires (it has, for `onAcceptPress` and `onDeclinePress`), or what state the timer is in when `onTimeOutDialog` fires.

#### A11-10: `onCreateView` and `onActivityCreated` override methods have no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibCommon/src/main/java/com/yy/libcommon/YesNoDialog.java`, Lines: 36, 88
- Description: The overridden lifecycle methods `onCreateView` and `onActivityCreated` have no Javadoc noting the non-default behaviors they introduce: `onCreateView` disables the dialog title bar and makes the dialog non-cancellable; `onActivityCreated` drives the entire initialization sequence (`init`, `setInitialValues`, `setListeners`). These are not inherited behaviors; the departures from the base class contract should be documented.

## File: LibImagePicker/src/androidTest/java/com/pizidea/imagepicker/ApplicationTest.java

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `ApplicationTest extends ApplicationTestCase<Application>` (line 9) — public test class
- Class-level Javadoc: A hyperlink comment at lines 6–8 pointing to Android testing documentation (`http://d.android.com/tools/testing/testing_android.html`); no prose description.
- Public Methods:
  - `ApplicationTest()` (line 10) — public constructor
- Constants/Types: None

### Findings

#### A11-11: `ApplicationTest` constructor has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `LibImagePicker/src/androidTest/java/com/pizidea/imagepicker/ApplicationTest.java`, Line: 10
- Description: The public constructor `ApplicationTest()` has no Javadoc. In `ApplicationTestCase` subclasses the constructor call to `super(Application.class)` establishes the class under test; this is not explained. Given this is a boilerplate auto-generated test stub with no test methods, the practical impact is minimal. Noted for completeness as the only public member.
