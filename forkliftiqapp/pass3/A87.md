# Pass 3 Findings: A87

---

## File: EquipmentStatsActivity.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/EquipmentStatsActivity.java`

### Reading Evidence
- **Class:** `EquipmentStatsActivity extends FleetActivity`
- **Public Methods:**
  - `onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)` (line 10) — overrides `FleetActivity`/`AppCompatActivity`; visibility is `protected` (not public)
- **Constants/Types:** None defined in this file.

### Findings

#### A87-1: `onCreate` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- **File:** EquipmentStatsActivity.java, Line: 10
- **Description:** The `onCreate` method override has no Javadoc comment. It performs three non-trivial operations beyond a simple layout inflate: calls `initKeyboard()` and loads `DriverStatsFragment3` into the fragment container without back-stack. A brief doc comment describing the purpose of this activity and the fragment it hosts would aid maintainability. Note: the class itself also lacks any class-level Javadoc.

## File: IncidentActivity.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/IncidentActivity.java`

### Reading Evidence
- **Class:** `IncidentActivity extends FleetActivity`
- **Public Methods:**
  - `onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)` (line 19) — `protected` override
  - `onBackPressed()` (line 36) — `public` override
- **Public Fields (not methods, but part of the public API surface):**
  - `impactParameter` — `ImpactParameter` (line 12)
  - `impactResult` — `SaveImpactResult` (line 13)
  - `signaturePath` — `String`, initialised to `null` (line 14)
  - `mCurrentPhotoPath` — `String` (line 15)
  - `injuryTypes` — `String[]` (line 16)
- **Constants/Types:** None defined in this file.

### Findings

#### A87-2: Class and all public members lack any Javadoc [INFO]
- **File:** IncidentActivity.java, Lines: 11–17
- **Description:** The class declaration and all five public fields (`impactParameter`, `impactResult`, `signaturePath`, `mCurrentPhotoPath`, `injuryTypes`) have no Javadoc. These fields form a shared-state contract used by child fragments (evidenced by them being `public`); their purpose, expected lifecycle state, and which component is responsible for populating them are undocumented. This is particularly notable for `impactResult`, which drives back-navigation behaviour in `onBackPressed`.

#### A87-3: `onBackPressed` has no Javadoc and its non-obvious conditional logic is unexplained [INFO]
- **File:** IncidentActivity.java, Line: 36
- **Description:** `onBackPressed` contains conditional logic: if `impactResult` is non-null (i.e. the impact has already been saved) the activity finishes immediately, bypassing the fragment back-stack; otherwise the default back-stack behaviour is used. This distinction is meaningful from a UX and correctness standpoint but is entirely undocumented. A doc comment explaining why a completed impact save causes a direct `finish()` would prevent future regressions (e.g. a developer removing the null check, thinking it is dead code).

#### A87-4: Redundant field assignment in `onCreate` is undocumented [INFO]
- **File:** IncidentActivity.java, Lines: 27 and 30
- **Description:** `impactParameter.injury` is assigned `false` twice in `onCreate` (line 27 and line 30). While this is not a documentation inaccuracy per se, the absence of any comment means the duplication is invisible to reviewers and could mask a copy-paste error (e.g. line 30 may have been intended to set a different field). Because there is no documentation, the intent cannot be verified against any stated specification.

## File: JobsActivity.java
**Full path:** `app/src/main/java/au/com/collectiveintelligence/fleetiq360/ui/activity/JobsActivity.java`

### Reading Evidence
- **Class:** `JobsActivity extends FleetActivity`
- **Public Methods:**
  - `onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)` (line 10) — `protected` override
- **Constants/Types:** None defined in this file.

### Findings

#### A87-5: Class and `onCreate` have no Javadoc [INFO]
- **File:** JobsActivity.java, Lines: 8–14
- **Description:** Neither the class nor its `onCreate` method override has a Javadoc comment. `onCreate` differs from `EquipmentStatsActivity`'s pattern in that it does not call `initKeyboard()` and uses a different layout (`activity_jobs` vs `activity_common`) and a different fragment container ID (`jobs_act_framelayout_id`). These differences are not documented and could cause confusion when comparing the two activity implementations.
