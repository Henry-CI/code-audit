# Pass 3 Findings: A39

## File: PauseOnScrollListener.java
**Full path:** `LibImageloader/src/main/java/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/listener/PauseOnScrollListener.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `PauseOnScrollListener` (implements `AbsListView.OnScrollListener`)
- Public Methods:
  - `PauseOnScrollListener(ImageLoader, boolean, boolean)` (line 49) — 3-arg constructor
  - `PauseOnScrollListener(ImageLoader, boolean, boolean, OnScrollListener)` (line 62) — 4-arg constructor
  - `onScrollStateChanged(AbsListView, int)` (line 71) — override
  - `onScroll(AbsListView, int, int, int)` (line 93) — override
- Constants/Types: None. Three private final fields: `imageLoader`, `pauseOnScroll`, `pauseOnFling`, `externalListener`.

### Findings

#### A39-1: `onScrollStateChanged` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `PauseOnScrollListener.java`, Line: 71
- Description: The method `onScrollStateChanged(AbsListView, int)` is public and carries non-trivial logic: it always resumes `ImageLoader` on `SCROLL_STATE_IDLE` (unconditionally, regardless of whether pausing was enabled), conditionally pauses on `SCROLL_STATE_TOUCH_SCROLL` based on `pauseOnScroll`, conditionally pauses on `SCROLL_STATE_FLING` based on `pauseOnFling`, and finally delegates to `externalListener` if one was provided. None of this behaviour is documented. The unconditional resume on idle is a subtle but important contract that callers cannot discover without reading the source.

#### A39-2: `onScroll` has no Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `PauseOnScrollListener.java`, Line: 93
- Description: The public method `onScroll(AbsListView, int, int, int)` has no Javadoc. Its sole behaviour — delegating to `externalListener` when non-null and otherwise doing nothing — is not documented. While the behaviour is simple, its role as a pass-through differs from the active pausing logic in `onScrollStateChanged` and is worth stating for completeness.

## File: SimpleImageLoadingListener.java
**Full path:** `LibImageloader/src/main/java/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/listener/SimpleImageLoadingListener.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `SimpleImageLoadingListener` (implements `ImageLoadingListener`)
- Public Methods:
  - `onLoadingStarted(String, View)` (line 32)
  - `onLoadingFailed(String, View, FailReason)` (line 37)
  - `onLoadingComplete(String, View, Bitmap)` (line 42)
  - `onLoadingCancelled(String, View)` (line 47)
- Constants/Types: None.

### Findings

#### A39-3: All four public methods lack individual Javadoc [INFO]
- File: `SimpleImageLoadingListener.java`, Lines: 32, 37, 42, 47
- Description: None of the four overridden public methods (`onLoadingStarted`, `onLoadingFailed`, `onLoadingComplete`, `onLoadingCancelled`) carry method-level Javadoc. The class-level Javadoc does state that all methods "do nothing", which accurately describes their empty-body implementation, so the risk is low. However, individual method documentation would be consistent with standard Javadoc practice and would explicitly confirm the no-op contract at the point of use (e.g., when a subclass overrides only one method and a developer inspects another). Reported as a grouped INFO finding rather than per-method to avoid noise.

## File: BitmapProcessor.java
**Full path:** `LibImageloader/src/main/java/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/process/BitmapProcessor.java`

### Reading Evidence
- Class: `BitmapProcessor` (interface)
- Public Methods:
  - `process(Bitmap)` (line 39)
- Constants/Types: None.

### Findings

No findings. The interface-level Javadoc accurately describes the contract (thread-safety requirement, processing intent). The single method `process(Bitmap)` has complete and accurate Javadoc covering its execution thread, the `@param`, the `@return`, and the important note about recycling the incoming bitmap when used as a pre-processor.
