## Reading Evidence

### File 1: `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/Permissions.java`

- 39 lines total.
- Uses Lombok annotations: `@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@EqualsAndHashCode(onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)`, `@Builder` (on private constructor).
- `@Data` generates: `getId()`, `setId()`, `getDriver_id()`, `setDriver_id()`, `getDriver_name()`, `setDriver_name()`, `getComp_id()`, `setComp_id()`, `getEnabled()`, `setEnabled()`, `getGsm_token()`, `setGsm_token()`, `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `canEqual()`.
- `@Builder` on a private constructor generates a public static `builder()` method and a public static inner class `PermissionsBuilder` with public methods: `id()`, `driver_id()`, `driver_name()`, `comp_id()`, `enabled()`, `gsm_token()`, `build()`.
- No class-level Javadoc.
- No field-level Javadoc.
- No Javadoc on any Lombok-generated or explicitly declared member.
- The `serialVersionUID` field has no comment.
- There is no explicit `Serializable` contract documentation.
- Field `enabled` is typed as `String` despite the semantic implication of a boolean state; no documentation clarifies the expected values.
- Field `gsm_token` has no documentation explaining its purpose, format, or sensitivity classification.

### File 2: `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/Questions.java`

- 37 lines total.
- Plain Java class (no Lombok); manually written accessors.
- Public methods: `getId()`, `setId(int)`, `getContent()`, `setContent(String)`, `getExpectedanswer()`, `setExpectedanswer(String)`.
- No class-level Javadoc.
- No field-level Javadoc.
- No method-level Javadoc on any accessor.
- The `serialVersionUID` field has an auto-generated empty `/** */` block comment (lines 7–9) that contains no actual documentation text – it is a stub.
- Field `expectedanswer` uses non-standard naming (no camelCase separation between "expected" and "answer"); no documentation explains this deviation.

### File 3: `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/ReportLists.java`

- 51 lines total.
- Plain Java class (no Lombok); manually written accessors.
- Public methods: `getComp_id()`, `setComp_id(int)`, `getFrequency()`, `setFrequency(String)`, `getFile_name()`, `setFile_name(String)`, `getId()`, `setId(int)`, `getName()`, `setName(String)`.
- No class-level Javadoc.
- No field-level Javadoc.
- No method-level Javadoc on any accessor.
- The `serialVersionUID` field has an auto-generated empty `/** */` block comment (lines 7–9) containing no text – it is a stub.
- An inline comment `// subscription table` on line 10 sits immediately after the `serialVersionUID` Javadoc stub, in an unusual and potentially misleading position. It is unclear whether the comment describes the `serialVersionUID` field or the class as a whole.
- Field and method names use snake_case (`comp_id`, `file_name`, `getComp_id()`, `getFile_name()`, `setFile_name()`) violating Java naming conventions; no documentation acknowledges or explains this.
- `frequency` field has no documentation specifying expected values (e.g. DAILY, WEEKLY).

## Findings

### A20-1
**Severity: HIGH**
**File:** `Permissions.java`
**Lines:** 13 (class declaration)
**Issue: No class-level Javadoc on `Permissions`.**
The `Permissions` class has no Javadoc comment. There is no explanation of what entity this class models, what database table or domain concept it corresponds to, its thread-safety characteristics, or its relationship to other domain objects such as drivers or companies.

---

### A20-2
**Severity: HIGH**
**File:** `Questions.java`
**Lines:** 5 (class declaration)
**Issue: No class-level Javadoc on `Questions`.**
The `Questions` class has no Javadoc. The class name is plural (`Questions`) yet it models a single question record; this is a semantic inconsistency that requires documentation to resolve. There is no explanation of what the `expectedanswer` field represents in a forklift inspection context or how questions are used in the application workflow.

---

### A20-3
**Severity: HIGH**
**File:** `ReportLists.java`
**Lines:** 5 (class declaration)
**Issue: No class-level Javadoc on `ReportLists`.**
The `ReportLists` class has no Javadoc. An inline comment (`// subscription table`) on line 10 appears to be an informal remnant note about the backing database table, but it is placed after the `serialVersionUID` stub comment and carries no useful context about the class's role in report generation, scheduling, or subscription management.

---

### A20-4
**Severity: HIGH**
**File:** `Questions.java`, `ReportLists.java`
**Lines:** Questions: 17–34; ReportLists: 19–48
**Issue: All public accessor methods in `Questions` and `ReportLists` are undocumented.**
None of the 16 public getter/setter methods across these two classes have any Javadoc. No method describes what it returns, what parameter constraints exist, or what side effects (if any) apply. For a public API surface consumed by service and DAO layers, this is a significant documentation gap.

---

### A20-5
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**File:** `Permissions.java`
**Lines:** 17–38 (fields and constructor)
**Issue: All Lombok-generated public methods and the `builder()` entry point are undocumented.**
Because Lombok generates the public API at compile time from field declarations, the field declarations themselves carry the documentation responsibility. None of the six fields (`id`, `driver_id`, `driver_name`, `comp_id`, `enabled`, `gsm_token`) have Javadoc. As a result, the entire generated public surface – including the static `builder()` factory and all builder setter methods – is undocumented.

---

### A20-6
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**File:** `Permissions.java`
**Lines:** 27–28 (`enabled` field)
**Issue: Field `enabled` typed as `String` with no documentation of valid values.**
The field name implies a boolean state, but the type is `String`. No Javadoc or comment documents what string values are valid (e.g. `"Y"`/`"N"`, `"true"`/`"false"`, `"1"`/`"0"`), what the default state means, or why a `boolean` type was not used. This ambiguity is a correctness risk for any code that evaluates this field.

---

### A20-7
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**File:** `Permissions.java`
**Lines:** 29 (`gsm_token` field)
**Issue: Field `gsm_token` has no documentation of its purpose, format, or security sensitivity.**
Token-type fields typically carry sensitivity implications (e.g. they may be credentials or session identifiers). There is no Javadoc describing what system this token authenticates against, its format, its lifecycle, or whether it should be masked in logs and serialized output. The `@Data`-generated `toString()` will expose this value in plain text.

---

### A20-8
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**File:** `Questions.java`
**Lines:** 7–9 (`serialVersionUID` Javadoc stub)
**Issue: Empty auto-generated Javadoc stub for `serialVersionUID` provides no documentation.**
The block comment `/** \n * \n */` on lines 7–9 is an IDE-generated stub with no content. It is misleading in that it gives the appearance of documentation while providing none. The same pattern appears in `ReportLists.java` (lines 7–9).

---

### A20-9
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**File:** `ReportLists.java`
**Lines:** 7–11 (`serialVersionUID` stub and inline comment)
**Issue: Empty Javadoc stub followed by misplaced inline comment creates misleading documentation.**
The auto-generated empty `/** */` stub (lines 7–9) is immediately followed by the inline comment `// subscription table` on line 10, before the `serialVersionUID` declaration on line 11. This arrangement visually associates `// subscription table` with `serialVersionUID` rather than with the class, making the comment's intent ambiguous and its informational value minimal.

---

### A20-10
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**File:** `ReportLists.java`
**Lines:** 19, 22, 31, 34 (snake_case accessor names)
**Issue: Public methods `getComp_id()`, `setComp_id()`, `getFile_name()`, `setFile_name()` use snake_case in violation of Java naming conventions, with no documentation acknowledging the deviation.**
These method names embed underscores, which breaks Java bean naming conventions and will cause issues with standard introspection tools (e.g. Jackson, BeanUtils, Spring MVC binding). The same pattern applies to fields in `Permissions.java` (`driver_id`, `driver_name`, `comp_id`, `gsm_token`) whose Lombok-generated accessors inherit the same problem. No documentation explains why this convention was chosen or what consumers must do to handle it.

---

### A20-11
**Severity: LOW**
**File:** `ReportLists.java`
**Lines:** 16 (`frequency` field)
**Issue: Field `frequency` has no documentation of its valid values or format.**
In a report scheduling context, `frequency` likely takes a constrained set of values such as `"DAILY"`, `"WEEKLY"`, or `"MONTHLY"`. No Javadoc, comment, or constraint annotation documents what values are accepted, whether the field is case-sensitive, or what happens when an unrecognised value is stored.

---

### A20-12
**Severity: LOW**
**File:** `Questions.java`
**Lines:** 14 (`expectedanswer` field)
**Issue: Field `expectedanswer` deviates from camelCase naming and has no documentation.**
The field should be named `expectedAnswer` per Java conventions. No documentation explains the deviation or describes what values this field holds in the context of forklift inspection questions (e.g. `"YES"`, `"NO"`, a numeric score, or free text).

---

### A20-13
**Severity: LOW**
**File:** `Permissions.java`
**Lines:** 13
**Issue: No documentation of `Serializable` contract or `serialVersionUID` rationale.**
The class implements `Serializable` and declares a `serialVersionUID`, but there is no Javadoc explaining why the class is serializable, what serialization mechanism is used (Java object serialization, session storage, caching), or what the consequences are of changing the class structure relative to persisted versions.
The same absence applies to `Questions.java` and `ReportLists.java`.
