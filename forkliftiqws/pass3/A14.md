## Reading Evidence

### File 1: Equipment.java
**Path:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/Equipment.java`
**Lines:** 61
**Summary:** A Lombok-annotated POJO model class implementing `Serializable`. Uses `@Data` (generates getters, setters, `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`) and `@NoArgsConstructor`. Also provides an explicit `@Builder`-annotated all-args constructor. Contains 18 fields representing equipment metadata including identifiers, status flags, hardware addressing, and impact threshold configuration.

**Fields:**
- `id` (int) - equipment identifier
- `name` (String) - equipment name
- `type_id` (int) - foreign key to equipment type
- `comp_id` (int) - foreign key to company
- `active` (boolean) - active status flag
- `manu_id` (int) - foreign key to manufacturer
- `fuel_type_id` (int) - foreign key to fuel type
- `attachment_id` (int) - foreign key to attachment
- `type` (String) - denormalized type name
- `manu` (String) - denormalized manufacturer name
- `fuel_type` (String) - denormalized fuel type name
- `comp` (String) - denormalized company name
- `serial_no` (String) - serial number
- `mac_address` (String) - MAC address (hardware identifier)
- `url` (String) - URL (possibly device endpoint)
- `impact_threshold` (long) - impact force threshold
- `alert_enabled` (boolean) - impact alert toggle
- `driver_based` (boolean) - driver-based assignment flag

**Public methods (Lombok-generated, no explicit source body):**
- `getId()`, `setId(int)`, `getName()`, `setName(String)`, `getType_id()`, `setType_id(int)`, `getComp_id()`, `setComp_id(int)`, `isActive()`, `setActive(boolean)`, `getManu_id()`, `setManu_id(int)`, `getFuel_type_id()`, `setFuel_type_id(int)`, `getAttachment_id()`, `setAttachment_id(int)`, `getType()`, `setType(String)`, `getManu()`, `setManu(String)`, `getFuel_type()`, `setFuel_type(String)`, `getComp()`, `setComp(String)`, `getSerial_no()`, `setSerial_no(String)`, `getMac_address()`, `setMac_address(String)`, `getUrl()`, `setUrl(String)`, `getImpact_threshold()`, `setImpact_threshold(long)`, `isAlert_enabled()`, `setAlert_enabled(boolean)`, `isDriver_based()`, `setDriver_based(boolean)`, `equals(Object)`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`
- Explicit: `Equipment(int, String, int, int, boolean, int, int, int, String, String, String, String, String, String, String, long, boolean, boolean)` - all-args constructor (annotated `@Builder`)
- `Equipment()` - no-args constructor (Lombok `@NoArgsConstructor`)

**Javadoc present:** None - no class-level Javadoc, no field-level Javadoc, no constructor Javadoc.

---

### File 2: EquipmentType.java
**Path:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring\jdbc/model/EquipmentType.java`
**Lines:** 36
**Summary:** A plain Java POJO implementing `Serializable`. No Lombok annotations; all getters and setters are written manually. Represents an equipment type with three fields: `id`, `name`, and `icon`. Contains a stub Javadoc comment on `serialVersionUID` that is empty (auto-generated placeholder only).

**Fields:**
- `id` (int) - type identifier
- `name` (String) - type name
- `icon` (String) - icon identifier/path

**Public methods (explicit source):**
1. `getId()` - returns `id`
2. `setId(int id)` - sets `id`
3. `getName()` - returns `name`
4. `setName(String name)` - sets `name`
5. `getIcon()` - returns `icon`
6. `setIcon(String icon)` - sets `icon`

**Javadoc present:** Only the auto-generated empty Javadoc stub on `serialVersionUID` (lines 7-9: `/** \n * \n */`). No class-level Javadoc. No method-level Javadoc on any of the six public methods.

---

### File 3: ErrorMessage.java
**Path:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/ErrorMessage.java`
**Lines:** 20
**Summary:** A Lombok-annotated POJO implementing `Serializable`. Uses `@Data` and `@NoArgsConstructor`. Represents an API error response structure with three string fields: `message`, `code`, and `detail`. Contains a stub auto-generated Javadoc comment on `serialVersionUID` that is empty.

**Fields:**
- `message` (String) - error message text
- `code` (String) - error code
- `detail` (String) - detailed error description

**Public methods (Lombok-generated, no explicit source body):**
- `getMessage()`, `setMessage(String)`, `getCode()`, `setCode(String)`, `getDetail()`, `setDetail(String)`, `equals(Object)`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`
- `ErrorMessage()` - no-args constructor (Lombok `@NoArgsConstructor`)

**Javadoc present:** Only the auto-generated empty Javadoc stub on `serialVersionUID` (lines 12-14: `/** \n * \n */`). No class-level Javadoc. No field-level or method-level Javadoc.

## Findings

### A14-1
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `Equipment.java`
**Location:** Class declaration, line 11
**Finding:** The `Equipment` class has no class-level Javadoc comment. This is a core domain model class with 18 fields, several of which have non-obvious semantics (e.g., `driver_based`, `alert_enabled`, `impact_threshold`, `url`, the distinction between `type`/`type_id`, `manu`/`manu_id`, `comp`/`comp_id`, `fuel_type`/`fuel_type_id`). The absence of class-level documentation leaves the purpose, lifecycle, and data model conventions entirely undocumented for the class that represents the primary business entity of the application.

---

### A14-2
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `Equipment.java`
**Location:** Constructor, lines 34-56
**Finding:** The explicit all-args `@Builder` constructor has no Javadoc. Given the constructor accepts 18 parameters, many of which share the same type (`int`, `boolean`, `String`), the absence of `@param` documentation for each parameter is a significant maintainability risk. The purpose and valid values of non-obvious parameters such as `impact_threshold` (unit unspecified - could be g-force, milliseconds, or arbitrary units), `url` (target endpoint unknown), `driver_based` (semantics unclear), and `attachment_id` are completely undocumented.

---

### A14-3
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `Equipment.java`
**Location:** Fields, lines 14-31
**Finding:** No field-level Javadoc exists for any of the 18 fields. Several fields have ambiguous or non-obvious semantics that would benefit from documentation:
- `url` - no indication of what URL this refers to (device endpoint, image URL, configuration URL, etc.)
- `impact_threshold` (`long`) - the unit of measurement is unspecified
- `driver_based` - the behavioral implication of this flag is undocumented
- `attachment_id` - the referenced entity type is unclear from the field name alone
- `comp` / `comp_id` - abbreviation meaning (company) is implied but not stated
- `manu` / `manu_id` - abbreviation meaning (manufacturer) is implied but not stated

---

### A14-4
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `Equipment.java`
**Location:** Lombok-generated methods (all public getters/setters/equals/hashCode/toString)
**Finding:** All public methods on `Equipment` are Lombok-generated via `@Data` and therefore have no Javadoc in the source. While Lombok is a legitimate convention, none of the 39+ generated public methods carry documentation. This affects `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` in particular, where non-standard or surprising behavior (e.g., equality based on all fields including `mac_address`) is not documented at the class level.

---

### A14-5
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `EquipmentType.java`
**Location:** Class declaration, line 5
**Finding:** The `EquipmentType` class has no class-level Javadoc. The class purpose, its relationship to `Equipment.type_id`, and the semantics of the `icon` field (whether it is a CSS class name, a file path, a URL, or some other identifier) are entirely undocumented.

---

### A14-6
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `EquipmentType.java`
**Location:** `serialVersionUID`, lines 7-10
**Finding:** The Javadoc block present on the `serialVersionUID` field (lines 7-9) is an empty auto-generated stub (`/** \n * \n */`). It contains no content and provides no documentation value. This constitutes inaccurate/misleading documentation in the sense that a Javadoc block exists but is substantively empty, which can create a false impression that fields were reviewed for documentation purposes.

---

### A14-7
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `EquipmentType.java`
**Location:** All public methods, lines 16-33
**Finding:** None of the six manually-written public accessor methods (`getId`, `setId`, `getName`, `setName`, `getIcon`, `setIcon`) have Javadoc. While these are simple accessors, the absence of any `@return` or `@param` documentation is inconsistent with professional Javadoc standards. In particular, `getIcon` and `setIcon` are candidates for documentation explaining what format the icon value takes.

---

### A14-8
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `ErrorMessage.java`
**Location:** Class declaration, line 10
**Finding:** The `ErrorMessage` class has no class-level Javadoc. This class appears to represent a standardized API error response envelope. The distinction between `message`, `code`, and `detail` fields - which is critical for API consumers - is entirely undocumented. Specifically: whether `code` is a numeric HTTP status code, an application-defined error code, or some other code scheme; and whether `detail` is intended for end-user display or internal logging is unknown from the source alone.

---

### A14-9
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `ErrorMessage.java`
**Location:** `serialVersionUID`, lines 12-14
**Finding:** As with `EquipmentType`, the Javadoc block on `serialVersionUID` is an empty auto-generated stub. It contains no content and provides no documentation value. Its presence is misleading as it implies intentional documentation review occurred.

---

### A14-10
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `ErrorMessage.java`
**Location:** Fields, lines 16-18
**Finding:** No field-level Javadoc exists for `message`, `code`, or `detail`. The API contract that this class represents (i.e., what each field carries in a live HTTP error response) is undocumented. The `code` field in particular warrants documentation: it is typed as `String` rather than `int`, which is a non-obvious choice for a code value, and the expected format or value set is unspecified.

---

### A14-11
**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `ErrorMessage.java`
**Location:** Lombok-generated methods
**Finding:** All public methods on `ErrorMessage` are Lombok-generated via `@Data` and have no Javadoc in source. While less critical for a simple DTO, the absence of documentation on `equals` and `hashCode` means the equality contract (equality by all three fields: `message`, `code`, `detail`) is not stated anywhere in the source.

---

### A14-12
**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `Equipment.java`, `EquipmentType.java`, `ErrorMessage.java`
**Location:** All three files
**Finding:** None of the three classes carry package-level documentation or any `@author`, `@since`, or `@version` Javadoc tags. While these tags are optional, the complete absence of any authorship or versioning metadata in the documentation makes it impossible to determine from source alone when these classes were introduced, by whom, or what API version they correspond to. This is consistent across all three model classes and represents a systemic gap in documentation standards.
