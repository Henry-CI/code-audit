## Reading Evidence

### File 1: UserController.java

- **Lines:** 33
- **Package:** `com.journaldev.spring.jdbc.controller`
- **Class:** `UserController` (annotated `@Controller`)
- **Fields:** `userDao` (private, `@Autowired`, type `UserDAO`)
- **Class-level Javadoc:** None present.
- **Public Methods Enumerated:**

| Method | Signature | Javadoc Present |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| `getUserByEmail` | `public @ResponseBody ResponseEntity<User> getUserByEmail(@RequestParam("email") String email)` | No |

- **Observations:**
  - No class-level Javadoc.
  - No method-level Javadoc on the sole public endpoint method.
  - The method is a REST endpoint mapped to `GET /rest/admin/user`. Despite being security-sensitive (admin route, returns `User` object), it is entirely undocumented.
  - The method parameter is named `email` (the `@RequestParam`) but the internal delegate call is `userDao.findByName(email)`, which is a semantic mismatch — the parameter is an email address but the DAO call is named `findByName`. This discrepancy has no explanatory documentation.
  - On failure the method returns `HttpStatus.BAD_GATEWAY` (502). This is semantically incorrect for a "not found" case (which should be 404), and there is no documentation explaining the intent.
  - The `serialVersionUID` auto-generated Javadoc stub (`/** * */`) is not present in this file (it is not `Serializable`).

### File 2: APIConnections.java

- **Lines:** 33
- **Package:** `com.journaldev.spring.jdbc.model`
- **Class:** `APIConnections` (implements `Serializable`)
- **Fields:**
  - `serialVersionUID` (private static final long) — has a stub Javadoc `/** * */` (empty, meaningless)
  - `IDAPIConnection` (private int)
  - `APIConnectionKey` (private String)
- **Class-level Javadoc:** None present.
- **Public Methods Enumerated:**

| Method | Signature | Javadoc Present |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| `getIDAPIConnection` | `public int getIDAPIConnection()` | No |
| `setIDAPIConnection` | `public void setIDAPIConnection(int iDAPIConnection)` | No |
| `getAPIConnectionKey` | `public String getAPIConnectionKey()` | No |
| `setAPIConnectionKey` | `public void setAPIConnectionKey(String aPIConnectionKey)` | No |

- **Observations:**
  - No class-level Javadoc. The purpose of `APIConnections` (what API, what connection model it represents) is entirely undocumented.
  - No field-level Javadoc on `IDAPIConnection` or `APIConnectionKey`.
  - The `serialVersionUID` carries an auto-generated empty stub Javadoc (`/** * */`) — this is a placeholder only, conveying no information.
  - All four accessor/mutator methods lack Javadoc.
  - Field and parameter naming conventions are non-standard (Pascal-case `IDAPIConnection`, `APIConnectionKey`) but there is no documentation to explain this deviation.

### File 3: Answers.java

- **Lines:** 36
- **Package:** `com.journaldev.spring.jdbc.model`
- **Class:** `Answers` (implements `Serializable`)
- **Fields:**
  - `serialVersionUID` (private static final long) — has a stub Javadoc `/** * */` (empty, meaningless)
  - `id` (private int)
  - `answer` (private String)
  - `question_id` (private int)
- **Class-level Javadoc:** None present.
- **Public Methods Enumerated:**

| Method | Signature | Javadoc Present |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| `getId` | `public int getId()` | No |
| `setId` | `public void setId(int id)` | No |
| `getAnswer` | `public String getAnswer()` | No |
| `setAnswer` | `public void setAnswer(String answer)` | No |
| `getQuestion_id` | `public int getQuestion_id()` | No |
| `setQuestion_id` | `public void setQuestion_id(int question_id)` | No |

- **Observations:**
  - No class-level Javadoc. The class name `Answers` is plural but represents a single answer record; this ambiguity is not explained.
  - No field-level Javadoc.
  - The `serialVersionUID` carries an auto-generated empty stub Javadoc (`/** * */`) — placeholder only.
  - All six accessor/mutator methods lack Javadoc.
  - `getQuestion_id` / `setQuestion_id` use a non-standard snake_case naming convention for a Java method; this deviation is unexplained by any documentation.

## Findings

---

### A10-1
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/controller/UserController.java`
**Location:** Class `UserController`, method `getUserByEmail` (line 23)
**Finding:** The only public method in the REST controller, `getUserByEmail`, has no Javadoc whatsoever. This is an admin-level HTTP endpoint handling user lookup by email. There is no documentation describing the HTTP contract, the parameter, the possible response codes, or the business purpose of the endpoint.

---

### A10-2
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/controller/UserController.java`
**Location:** Class `UserController` (line 17)
**Finding:** The class `UserController` has no class-level Javadoc. For a Spring `@Controller` exposing REST endpoints — especially under the `/rest/admin/` path — the absence of any class-level documentation leaves the scope, responsibilities, and security context of the controller entirely undescribed.

---

### A10-3
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/controller/UserController.java`
**Location:** `getUserByEmail`, line 31 — `return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.BAD_GATEWAY);`
**Finding:** The method returns `HTTP 502 BAD_GATEWAY` when a user is not found. This is semantically incorrect (502 indicates a bad upstream gateway response, not a missing resource), and there is no Javadoc, inline comment, or any other documentation explaining why this status code was chosen. The undocumented misleading status constitutes an accuracy defect in the absence of any clarifying documentation.

---

### A10-4
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/controller/UserController.java`
**Location:** `getUserByEmail`, line 25 — `userDao.findByName(email)`
**Finding:** The request parameter is semantically an email address (`@RequestParam("email")`), but the DAO method called is `findByName(email)`. This naming mismatch between the parameter type (`email`) and the DAO method (`findByName`) is undocumented. There is no Javadoc or inline comment to explain whether `findByName` accepts email addresses as names, or whether this represents a design defect.

---

### A10-5
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/APIConnections.java`
**Location:** Class `APIConnections` (line 5)
**Finding:** The class `APIConnections` has no class-level Javadoc. The class name does not communicate which API, which connection model, or what system this entity represents. Without documentation, the semantic purpose of this model class is opaque.

---

### A10-6
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/Answers.java`
**Location:** Class `Answers` (line 5)
**Finding:** The class `Answers` has no class-level Javadoc. The plural class name representing a singular record, combined with a `question_id` foreign key field, suggests a data model for a survey/questionnaire system, but this is entirely unspecified in documentation.

---

### A10-7
**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/APIConnections.java`
**Location:** Methods `getIDAPIConnection` (line 18), `setIDAPIConnection` (line 21), `getAPIConnectionKey` (line 24), `setAPIConnectionKey` (line 27)
**Finding:** All four public accessor/mutator methods in `APIConnections` lack Javadoc. While simple getters/setters are often considered low-priority for documentation, the non-standard Pascal-case field names (`IDAPIConnection`, `APIConnectionKey`) make the meaning and constraints of these fields non-obvious without documentation.

---

### A10-8
**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/Answers.java`
**Location:** Methods `getId` (line 16), `setId` (line 19), `getAnswer` (line 22), `setAnswer` (line 25), `getQuestion_id` (line 29), `setQuestion_id` (line 32)
**Finding:** All six public accessor/mutator methods in `Answers` lack Javadoc. In particular, `getQuestion_id` and `setQuestion_id` use non-standard snake_case naming for Java methods (a convention violation), and there is no documentation to explain whether this reflects a database column naming convention or a deliberate design choice.

---

### A10-9
**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/APIConnections.java`
**Location:** Line 9-11 — `/** * */` on `serialVersionUID`
**Finding:** The `serialVersionUID` field carries an IDE-generated empty Javadoc stub (`/** * */`). This placeholder is not a documentation comment — it communicates nothing and constitutes a documentation artifact rather than meaningful documentation. It is misleading in that it appears to satisfy tooling checks while providing no information.

---

### A10-10
**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `src/main/java/com/journaldev/spring/jdbc/model/Answers.java`
**Location:** Lines 7-9 — `/** * */` on `serialVersionUID`
**Finding:** Same as A10-9. The `serialVersionUID` field in `Answers` carries an identical empty Javadoc stub (`/** * */`), which is a meaningless placeholder with no documentary value.

---
