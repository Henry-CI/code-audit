## Reading Evidence

### File 1 — GPS.java

- **Package:** `com.journaldev.spring.jdbc.model`
- **Class declaration:** `public class GPS implements Serializable`
- **Line count:** 63
- **Implements:** `java.io.Serializable`
- **Fields (all private):**
  - `int id`
  - `int unit_id`
  - `Float longitude`
  - `Float latitude`
  - `String gps_time`
  - `boolean current_location`
  - `String unit_name`
- **Class-level Javadoc:** ABSENT
- **`serialVersionUID` Javadoc:** Present but empty (lines 7-9: `/** \n * \n */`) — a stub with no content.
- **Public methods enumerated (14 total):**

| Method | Line | Javadoc Present |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| `getId()` | 20 | No |
| `setId(int id)` | 23 | No |
| `getUnit_id()` | 26 | No |
| `setUnit_id(int unit_id)` | 29 | No |
| `getLongitude()` | 32 | No |
| `setLongitude(Float longitude)` | 35 | No |
| `getLatitude()` | 38 | No |
| `setLatitude(Float latitude)` | 41 | No |
| `getGps_time()` | 44 | No |
| `setGps_time(String gps_time)` | 47 | No |
| `isCurrent_location()` | 50 | No |
| `setCurrent_location(boolean current_location)` | 53 | No |
| `getUnit_name()` | 56 | No |
| `setUnit_name(String unit_name)` | 59 | No |

- **Documentation coverage:** 0 / 14 public methods documented (0%).
- **Additional observations:**
  - Naming convention uses snake_case for fields and derived accessor names (e.g., `getUnit_id`, `isCurrent_location`, `getGps_time`) which is non-standard for Java. This compounds documentation risk because generated or tool-parsed Javadoc will not have any guidance on intent.
  - `gps_time` is typed as `String` rather than a temporal type (e.g., `java.time.Instant`, `java.util.Date`). No Javadoc clarifies expected format.
  - `longitude` and `latitude` use `Float` (nullable wrapper) instead of primitive `float`. No Javadoc clarifies null semantics.

### File 2 — GPSList.java

- **Package:** `com.journaldev.spring.jdbc.model`
- **Class declaration:** `public class GPSList implements Serializable`
- **Line count:** 26
- **Implements:** `java.io.Serializable`
- **Fields:**
  - `List<GPS> gpsList` — package-private (no access modifier); initialized to `new ArrayList<GPS>()`
- **Class-level Javadoc:** ABSENT
- **`serialVersionUID` Javadoc:** ABSENT (no comment of any kind)
- **Public methods enumerated (2 total):**

| Method | Line | Javadoc Present |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| `getGpsList()` | 15 | No |
| `setGpsList(List<GPS> gpsList)` | 20 | No |

- **Documentation coverage:** 0 / 2 public methods documented (0%).
- **Additional observations:**
  - The field `gpsList` has no access modifier (package-private), which is inconsistent with the private fields of `GPS.java`. No documentation explains the design intent.
  - The class serves as a serializable wrapper/container for a list of `GPS` objects; this purpose is entirely undocumented.

### File 3 — Impact.java

- **Package:** `com.journaldev.spring.jdbc.model`
- **Class declaration:** `public class Impact implements Serializable`
- **Line count:** 26
- **Implements:** `java.io.Serializable`
- **Annotations:** `@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor` (Lombok), `@Builder` (on private constructor)
- **Fields (all private):**
  - `long impact_value`
  - `String impact_time`
  - `String mac_address`
- **Class-level Javadoc:** ABSENT
- **`serialVersionUID` Javadoc:** ABSENT
- **Lombok-generated public methods (via `@Data` and `@NoArgsConstructor`):**
  - `getImpact_value()` — Lombok-generated, no source Javadoc
  - `setImpact_value(long impact_value)` — Lombok-generated, no source Javadoc
  - `getImpact_time()` — Lombok-generated, no source Javadoc
  - `setImpact_time(String impact_time)` — Lombok-generated, no source Javadoc
  - `getMac_address()` — Lombok-generated, no source Javadoc
  - `setMac_address(String mac_address)` — Lombok-generated, no source Javadoc
  - `equals(Object o)` — Lombok-generated
  - `hashCode()` — Lombok-generated
  - `toString()` — Lombok-generated
  - `Impact()` (no-args constructor) — Lombok-generated via `@NoArgsConstructor`
- **Explicit non-public methods:**
  - `Impact(long, String, String)` (lines 21-25) — `private` constructor annotated `@Builder`; not public, but is the designated construction entry point via the builder pattern. No Javadoc.
- **Documentation coverage:** 0 Javadoc comments on any field, constructor, or class (0%).
- **Additional observations:**
  - `@Builder` is placed on a `private` constructor. The Lombok `@Builder` annotation on a private constructor still generates a public static `Impact.builder()` factory method and a public inner `Impact.ImpactBuilder` class with public methods. These generated public API surfaces carry no Javadoc whatsoever.
  - `impact_time` is `String`; no documentation clarifies the expected timestamp format or timezone convention.
  - `impact_value` is `long`; no documentation clarifies units (G-force, raw sensor reading, enumerated severity level, etc.). This is a significant semantic gap for a safety-critical domain.
  - `mac_address` is undocumented; no clarification of which hardware device this refers to (forklift unit, gateway, sensor, etc.).
  - The unused `import java.util.Date` on line 8 is present despite `Date` not being used anywhere in the class. This import contributes to confusion and suggests `impact_time` may have previously been a `Date` field before being changed to `String`, without documentation of the rationale.

## Findings

### A17-1
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `GPS.java`
**Location:** Class level and all 14 public methods
**Description:** The class `GPS` has no class-level Javadoc, and all 14 public accessor/mutator methods are entirely undocumented. The class models a GPS coordinate record that is central to forklift location tracking. The absence of documentation means that consumers of this API have no authoritative description of field semantics, units, or constraints. Specifically, there is no documentation for: the expected format of `gps_time` (a `String`), the null semantics of `Float`-typed `longitude` and `latitude`, or the meaning of `current_location`.
**Evidence:** GPS.java lines 5-63; zero Javadoc blocks found on any public member.

---

### A17-2
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `GPS.java`
**Location:** Lines 7-9 (`serialVersionUID`)
**Description:** A Javadoc comment block is present for the `serialVersionUID` field but contains only whitespace — it is an empty stub (`/** \n * \n */`). This constitutes a misleading documentation artifact: it appears as though documentation was started but never completed, and Javadoc tooling will render an empty comment. The stub provides no value and suggests the file was incompletely documented.
**Evidence:** GPS.java lines 7-9.

---

### A17-3
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `GPSList.java`
**Location:** Class level and all 2 public methods
**Description:** The class `GPSList` has no class-level Javadoc and neither of its two public methods (`getGpsList`, `setGpsList`) are documented. The purpose of this wrapper class — whether it exists for serialization, REST payload binding, legacy compatibility, or another reason — is entirely undocumented. Consumers cannot determine why a dedicated list wrapper exists rather than using `List<GPS>` directly.
**Evidence:** GPSList.java lines 7-26; zero Javadoc blocks found.

---

### A17-4
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `GPSList.java`
**Location:** Line 12
**Description:** The field `List<GPS> gpsList` has no access modifier, making it package-private. This is inconsistent with the encapsulation model applied in `GPS.java` (all private fields). Because there is no Javadoc or inline comment, there is no documentation explaining whether this is intentional (e.g., for framework access) or an oversight. The undocumented visibility level constitutes a documentation gap with potential behavioral impact.
**Evidence:** GPSList.java line 12: `List<GPS> gpsList = new ArrayList<GPS>();`

---

### A17-5
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**File:** `Impact.java`
**Location:** Class level, field `impact_value`, and all Lombok-generated public methods
**Description:** The class `Impact` models impact/collision events for forklifts, which is safety-critical domain data. The field `impact_value` (type `long`) has no Javadoc, inline comment, or any documentation of any kind. There is no specification of units (e.g., milliG, raw ADC counts, categorized severity 1-5), valid ranges, thresholds, or how this value is produced or consumed. In a safety-critical context, the complete absence of semantic documentation for an impact measurement field is a critical documentation deficiency.
**Evidence:** Impact.java lines 16-26; zero documentation on `impact_value` or any related method.

---

### A17-6
**Severity:** HIGH
**File:** `Impact.java`
**Location:** Class level and all Lombok-generated public API
**Description:** `Impact` uses Lombok `@Data` and `@Builder` annotations, which generate a substantial public API surface (getters, setters, `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`, a static `builder()` factory method, and a public `ImpactBuilder` inner class). None of this generated public API is documented at the source level through field-level or class-level Javadoc. While Lombok generation is a legitimate pattern, the source-level documentation (class Javadoc, field Javadoc) that would flow into generated members is entirely absent.
**Evidence:** Impact.java lines 10-26; `@Data` at line 10, `@Builder` at line 20, no Javadoc anywhere in file.

---

### A17-7
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `Impact.java`
**Location:** Line 8
**Description:** `import java.util.Date` is present but `Date` is not referenced anywhere in the class body. The unused import suggests a prior version of the class used `Date` for `impact_time` before it was changed to `String`. No comment documents this change or the rationale for using `String` for a timestamp field. The unused import is a documentation-quality issue because it misleads readers into thinking `Date` plays a role in the class.
**Evidence:** Impact.java line 8: `import java.util.Date;`; no usage of `Date` found anywhere in lines 1-26.

---

### A17-8
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `Impact.java`
**Location:** Line 17 (`impact_time`), Line 18 (`mac_address`)
**Description:** `impact_time` (type `String`) has no documentation specifying the expected date/time format, timezone, or locale. `mac_address` (type `String`) has no documentation identifying which hardware device the address belongs to (e.g., the forklift ECU, a BLE sensor, a network gateway). In a multi-device IoT system, undocumented string fields with device-identification semantics are a significant documentation gap.
**Evidence:** Impact.java lines 17-18.

---

### A17-9
**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `GPS.java`
**Location:** All accessor methods (lines 26-61)
**Description:** Method names use non-standard Java naming conventions derived from snake_case field names (e.g., `getUnit_id()`, `setUnit_id()`, `isCurrent_location()`, `getGps_time()`). Standard Java Bean convention would produce `getUnitId()`, `setUnitId()`, `isCurrentLocation()`, `getGpsTime()`. The absence of any Javadoc or class-level comment means there is no documentation explaining this deviation from convention or any notice to consumers that standard reflection-based tools (e.g., Jackson, Spring MVC data binding) may behave unexpectedly.
**Evidence:** GPS.java lines 26, 29, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59.

---

### A17-10
**Severity:** LOW
**File:** All three files (`GPS.java`, `GPSList.java`, `Impact.java`)
**Location:** Class declarations
**Description:** None of the three model classes has a `@since`, `@version`, or `@author` tag, nor any class-level Javadoc at all. While these tags are optional, their complete absence across the entire model package means there is no documentation of ownership, versioning, or historical context for any of these domain model classes.
**Evidence:** GPS.java line 5, GPSList.java line 7, Impact.java line 12 — all class declarations lack preceding Javadoc blocks.
