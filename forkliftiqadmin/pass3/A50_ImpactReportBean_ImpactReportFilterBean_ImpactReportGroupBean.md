## 2. Findings

### A50-1 [LOW] ImpactReportBean — No class-level Javadoc

**File:** `ImpactReportBean.java`, line 14
**Severity:** LOW

The class `ImpactReportBean` has no class-level Javadoc comment. Its purpose (a top-level container wrapping a list of `ImpactReportGroupBean` groups for an impact report response) is not documented anywhere in the source.

```java
// No /** ... */ present before:
public class ImpactReportBean implements Serializable {
```

---

### A50-2 [LOW] ImpactReportFilterBean — No class-level Javadoc

**File:** `ImpactReportFilterBean.java`, line 12
**Severity:** LOW

The class `ImpactReportFilterBean` has no class-level Javadoc. Its role as a filter bean extending `ReportFilterBean` with an additional `impactLevel` filter criterion is not described.

```java
// No /** ... */ present before:
public class ImpactReportFilterBean extends ReportFilterBean implements ImpactLevelFilter {
```

---

### A50-3 [LOW] ImpactReportGroupBean — No class-level Javadoc

**File:** `ImpactReportGroupBean.java`, line 14
**Severity:** LOW

The class `ImpactReportGroupBean` has no class-level Javadoc. Its purpose (grouping impact report entries by manufacturer and unit name) and its contract as a `Comparable` type are not documented.

```java
// No /** ... */ present before:
public class ImpactReportGroupBean implements Serializable, Comparable<ImpactReportGroupBean> {
```

---

### A50-4 [MEDIUM] ImpactReportFilterBean constructor — Undocumented non-trivial public method

**File:** `ImpactReportFilterBean.java`, line 16
**Severity:** MEDIUM

The `@Builder`-annotated public constructor has no Javadoc. It is non-trivial: it delegates date/manufacturer/type/timezone fields to the superclass `ReportFilterBean` and sets `impactLevel` locally. The responsibility split between this constructor and the parent constructor is not explained.

```java
@Builder
public ImpactReportFilterBean(Date startDate, Date endDate, Long manuId, Long typeId, ImpactLevel impactLevel, String timezone) {
    super(startDate, endDate, manuId, typeId, timezone);
    this.impactLevel = impactLevel;
}
```

No `@param` tags, no `@return` (N/A for constructor, but `@param` required for each of the 6 parameters).

---

### A50-5 [LOW] ImpactReportFilterBean.impactLevel() — Undocumented trivial override

**File:** `ImpactReportFilterBean.java`, line 22
**Severity:** LOW

The `impactLevel()` method implementing `ImpactLevelFilter` has no Javadoc. While trivial (a field accessor), it satisfies a named interface contract (`ImpactLevelFilter`) that may benefit from a note linking to the interface.

```java
@Override
public ImpactLevel impactLevel() {
    return impactLevel;
}
```

---

### A50-6 [MEDIUM] ImpactReportGroupBean.addEntry() — Undocumented non-trivial public method

**File:** `ImpactReportGroupBean.java`, line 30
**Severity:** MEDIUM

The public method `addEntry` has no Javadoc. It is non-trivial in context: it is the only mutation path for the `entries` list (the `@Builder`-constructed instance does not populate `entries`; entries must be added post-construction through this method). This design constraint is entirely undocumented.

```java
public void addEntry(ImpactReportGroupEntryBean impactReportModelEntry) {
    this.entries.add(impactReportModelEntry);
}
```

Missing: `@param impactReportModelEntry` documentation.

---

### A50-7 [MEDIUM] ImpactReportGroupBean.compareTo() — Undocumented non-trivial public method with logic defect risk

**File:** `ImpactReportGroupBean.java`, line 35
**Severity:** MEDIUM

The `compareTo` override has no Javadoc and implements a non-standard comparison strategy that may mislead readers. The method **adds** the results of two `String.compareTo()` calls:

```java
@Override
public int compareTo(ImpactReportGroupBean o) {
    return this.manufacturer.compareTo(o.manufacturer) + this.unitName.compareTo(o.unitName);
}
```

The `Comparable` contract requires that `compareTo` returns a negative integer, zero, or positive integer for less-than, equal-to, or greater-than. Summing two `String.compareTo()` results is not a standard lexicographic comparator: the sum can mask individual field differences (e.g., one field returns +5 and the other -5, yielding 0, incorrectly implying equality even when the two objects differ). The absence of any Javadoc means there is no stated intent for this behaviour, making it impossible to distinguish intentional design from a bug. Because this affects sort correctness, the lack of documentation on a non-trivial, contract-bearing method is rated MEDIUM.

Additionally, no `@param` or `@return` tags are present.
