## Reading Evidence

### ImpactReportGroupEntryBean.java

**Class:** `ImpactReportGroupEntryBean` — line 12
**Implements:** `Serializable`
**Annotations:** `@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor`

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Line |
|---|---|---|
| `serialVersionUID` | `static final long` | 13 |
| `id` | `Long` | 15 |
| `impactDateTime` | `String` | 16 |
| `impactValue` | `Integer` | 17 |
| `impactThreshold` | `Integer` | 18 |
| `driverName` | `String` | 19 |
| `companyName` | `String` | 20 |

**Methods:**

| Method | Visibility | Line |
|---|---|---|
| `ImpactReportGroupEntryBean(Long, String, Integer, Integer, String, String)` (constructor) | `private` | 23 |
| `getImpactLevel()` | `private` | 37 |
| `getGForce()` | `public` | 41 |
| `getImpactLevelCSSColor()` | `public` | 45 |

Note: `@Data` from Lombok generates public getters and setters for all fields at compile time (not visible in source). The two explicitly written `public` methods above are the only non-trivial public methods in the source.

### IncidentReportBean.java

**Class:** `IncidentReportBean` — line 15
**Implements:** `Serializable`
**Annotations:** `@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Line |
|---|---|---|
| `serialVersionUID` | `static final long` | 20 |
| `entries` | `List<IncidentReportEntryBean>` | 21 |

**Methods:** No explicitly declared methods. All accessors generated by Lombok `@Data`.

Note: The Javadoc block at lines 17–19 (`/** \n * \n */`) is attached to `serialVersionUID`, not to the class.

---

### IncidentReportEntryBean.java

**Class:** `IncidentReportEntryBean` — line 10
**Implements:** `Serializable`
**Annotations:** `@Data`, `@Builder`

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Line |
|---|---|---|
| `serialVersionUID` | `static final long` | 11 |
| `unitName` | `String` | 13 |
| `manufacture` | `String` | 14 |
| `companyName` | `String` | 15 |
| `driverName` | `String` | 16 |
| `reportTime` | `String` | 17 |
| `injureType` | `String` | 18 |
| `witness` | `String` | 19 |
| `location` | `String` | 20 |
| `injury` | `Boolean` | 21 |
| `description` | `String` | 22 |
| `signature` | `String` | 23 |
| `event_time` | `String` | 24 |
| `near_miss` | `Boolean` | 25 |
| `incident` | `Boolean` | 26 |
| `image` | `String` | 27 |

**Methods:** No explicitly declared methods. All accessors and builder generated by Lombok `@Data` and `@Builder`.

## Findings

### A51-1 [LOW] — ImpactReportGroupEntryBean: No class-level Javadoc

**File:** `bean/ImpactReportGroupEntryBean.java`, line 12
**Severity:** LOW

The class `ImpactReportGroupEntryBean` has no class-level Javadoc comment. There is no description of its purpose (representing a single row/entry in an impact report group), its role as a data-transfer/view bean, or the meaning of the fields it aggregates.

---

### A51-2 [MEDIUM] — ImpactReportGroupEntryBean.getGForce(): Undocumented non-trivial public method

**File:** `bean/ImpactReportGroupEntryBean.java`, line 41
**Severity:** MEDIUM

```java
public double getGForce() {
    return ImpactUtil.calculateGForceOfImpact(impactValue);
}
```

This public method performs a domain-specific calculation (converts a raw `impactValue` integer to a G-force `double` via `ImpactUtil.calculateGForceOfImpact`). It has no Javadoc comment. There is no documentation of:
- what `impactValue` represents or its expected unit/scale,
- how the G-force value is derived,
- the return unit (G),
- any boundary conditions (e.g., behaviour when `impactValue` is null or zero).

This is a non-trivial method; a caller cannot safely use it without understanding the underlying conversion.

---

### A51-3 [MEDIUM] — ImpactReportGroupEntryBean.getImpactLevelCSSColor(): Undocumented non-trivial public method

**File:** `bean/ImpactReportGroupEntryBean.java`, line 45
**Severity:** MEDIUM

```java
public String getImpactLevelCSSColor() {
    return ImpactUtil.getCSSColor(getImpactLevel());
}
```

This public method derives a CSS colour string based on the computed impact level (itself derived from `impactValue` and `impactThreshold`). It has no Javadoc. There is no documentation of:
- the set of possible return values (colour strings/CSS class names),
- how the impact level tiers map to specific colours,
- what happens if `impactValue` or `impactThreshold` is null.

---

### A51-4 [LOW] — IncidentReportBean: No class-level Javadoc

**File:** `bean/IncidentReportBean.java`, line 15
**Severity:** LOW

The class `IncidentReportBean` has no class-level Javadoc. Its purpose as a container/wrapper for a list of `IncidentReportEntryBean` records is not described.

---

### A51-5 [LOW] — IncidentReportBean: Empty/placeholder Javadoc on serialVersionUID field

**File:** `bean/IncidentReportBean.java`, lines 17–20
**Severity:** LOW

```java
/**
 *
 */
private static final long serialVersionUID = 6601870811260927831L;
```

A Javadoc block exists at lines 17–19 but contains no content — it is a completely empty auto-generated stub. While `serialVersionUID` is a private static field that does not require documentation, the presence of an empty Javadoc block is misleading (it implies documentation that does not exist) and adds noise to the source. It should either be removed or, if retained for tooling reasons, replaced with a brief note (e.g., `/** Required for {@link java.io.Serializable}. */`).

---

### A51-6 [LOW] — IncidentReportEntryBean: No class-level Javadoc

**File:** `bean/IncidentReportEntryBean.java`, line 10
**Severity:** LOW

The class `IncidentReportEntryBean` has no class-level Javadoc. Its purpose (a data-transfer object representing a single incident report record) and the semantics of its fields are undocumented. Several field names warrant explanation:
- `manufacture` (likely a typo for `manufacturer`) — no documentation clarifies intent.
- `event_time` vs `reportTime` — two time-related fields with different naming conventions (`snake_case` vs `camelCase`) and no documentation distinguishing their roles.
- `near_miss`, `incident` — boolean flags that are undocumented as to their mutual exclusivity or combined use.
- `image` — no documentation of what this field holds (file path, URL, Base64 data, etc.).

---

### A51-7 [LOW] — IncidentReportEntryBean: Mixed naming convention on fields (snake_case vs camelCase)

**File:** `bean/IncidentReportEntryBean.java`, lines 24–26
**Severity:** LOW (documentation gap perspective)

```java
private String event_time;    // line 24
private Boolean near_miss;    // line 25
private Boolean incident;     // line 26
```

Fields `event_time` and `near_miss` use `snake_case` while all other fields use `camelCase`. This inconsistency suggests these fields may have been added later (possibly mapped directly from a database column or external API) without aligning to Java naming conventions. There is no class-level or field-level Javadoc to explain the reason for the inconsistency, which would aid maintainers.

Note: This finding is raised from a documentation audit perspective (absence of explanatory comment). A naming convention fix itself is outside the scope of a documentation audit but is flagged here for awareness.
