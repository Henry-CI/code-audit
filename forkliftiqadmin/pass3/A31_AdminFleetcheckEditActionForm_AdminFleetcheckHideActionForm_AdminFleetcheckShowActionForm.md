**Class:** `AdminFleetcheckEditActionForm` — line 17
- Extends: `ActionForm`
- Annotations: `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@Slf4j`, `@NoArgsConstructor`
- No explicit constructor (handled by `@NoArgsConstructor` Lombok annotation)
- No explicitly declared methods

**Fields (all `private`, all on class lines 18–31):**

| Field | Type | Line |

| `arrAnswerType` | `ArrayList<AnswerTypeBean>` | 29 |
| `manu_id` | `String` | 30 |
| `attachment_id` | `String` | 31 |

**Explicitly declared methods:** None. Getters and setters are generated by Lombok `@Getter`/`@Setter`.

### AdminFleetcheckHideActionForm.java

**File path:** `src/main/java/com/actionform/AdminFleetcheckHideActionForm.java`

**Class:** `AdminFleetcheckHideActionForm` — line 14
- Extends: `ValidateIdExistsAbstractActionForm`
- Annotations: `@Getter`, `@Setter`

**Fields (all `private`):**

| Field | Type | Line |
|---|---|---|
| `type_id` | `String` | 15 |
| `fuel_type_id` | `String` | 16 |
| `manu_id` | `String` | 17 |
| `attachment_id` | `String` | 18 |

**Methods:**

| Method | Visibility | Return Type | Line |
|---|---|---|---|
| `validate(ActionMapping, HttpServletRequest)` | `public` (override) | `ActionErrors` | 21 |

### AdminFleetcheckShowActionForm.java

**File path:** `src/main/java/com/actionform/AdminFleetcheckShowActionForm.java`

**Class:** `AdminFleetcheckShowActionForm` — line 3
- Extends: `ValidateIdExistsAbstractActionForm`
- Annotations: None
- Body: Empty

**Fields:** None declared (inherits `id` from `ValidateIdExistsAbstractActionForm`)

**Methods:** None declared (inherits `validate` from `ValidateIdExistsAbstractActionForm`; Lombok `@Getter`/`@Setter` not present on this class, inherited getter/setter from parent)

## Findings

### A31-1 [LOW] — No class-level Javadoc: `AdminFleetcheckEditActionForm`

**File:** `AdminFleetcheckEditActionForm.java`, line 17

The class `AdminFleetcheckEditActionForm` has no class-level Javadoc comment. There is no `/** ... */` block above the class declaration. Given its role as an ActionForm carrying fleetcheck edit data (including question content, expected answer, ordering, active flag, type, fuel type, answer type, company, manufacturer, and attachment identifiers), a class-level description would aid maintainability.

---

### A31-2 [LOW] — No class-level Javadoc: `AdminFleetcheckHideActionForm`

**File:** `AdminFleetcheckHideActionForm.java`, line 14

The class `AdminFleetcheckHideActionForm` has no class-level Javadoc comment. The class extends `ValidateIdExistsAbstractActionForm` and overrides `validate` to add manufacturer, type, and fuel-type presence checks. No description exists to explain its purpose or the hide operation it supports.

---

### A31-3 [LOW] — No class-level Javadoc: `AdminFleetcheckShowActionForm`

**File:** `AdminFleetcheckShowActionForm.java`, line 3

The class `AdminFleetcheckShowActionForm` has no class-level Javadoc comment. Even though the class body is empty and delegates entirely to its parent `ValidateIdExistsAbstractActionForm`, a brief Javadoc indicating its intent (show operation, what entity it represents) is expected by standard Javadoc norms.

---

### A31-4 [LOW] — Undocumented Lombok-generated getters/setters: `AdminFleetcheckEditActionForm`

**File:** `AdminFleetcheckEditActionForm.java`, lines 13–14 (Lombok annotations)

All getters and setters for the 12 fields in `AdminFleetcheckEditActionForm` are generated by Lombok `@Getter`/`@Setter`. None of the fields carry Javadoc comments, so the generated accessor methods have no documentation. For trivial getters/setters this is LOW severity, but the absence of any field-level comments makes it impossible for a reader to understand the meaning of non-obvious fields such as `expectedanswer`, `comp_id`, `attachment_id`, or `arrAnswerType` without tracing the broader codebase.

---

### A31-5 [MEDIUM] — Undocumented non-trivial public method: `AdminFleetcheckHideActionForm.validate`

**File:** `AdminFleetcheckHideActionForm.java`, lines 21–38

The overridden `validate` method is public and non-trivial: it delegates to the superclass validation (which checks that `id` is non-empty) and then independently validates the presence of `manu_id`, `type_id`, and `fuel_type_id`, adding distinct `ActionErrors` entries for each missing field. There is no Javadoc block above the method declaration. As a result:

- There is no description of the validation rules enforced.
- There is no `@param` tag for `mapping` (type `ActionMapping`).
- There is no `@param` tag for `request` (type `HttpServletRequest`).
- There is no `@return` tag describing the returned `ActionErrors` object or the conditions under which it is populated.
- There is no `@Override` documentation note clarifying how this method extends the superclass behaviour.

Note: `attachment_id` is declared as a field on this class (line 18) but is notably **not validated** in `validate`. This may be intentional (attachment is optional for hide operations), but the absence of documentation makes this ambiguity unresolvable without broader analysis. This is flagged for reviewer attention but not raised as a separate finding given the current scope.

### A31-6 [LOW] — Undocumented Lombok-generated getters/setters: `AdminFleetcheckHideActionForm`

**File:** `AdminFleetcheckHideActionForm.java`, lines 12–13 (Lombok annotations)

All getters and setters for `type_id`, `fuel_type_id`, `manu_id`, and `attachment_id` are generated by Lombok without any accompanying field-level Javadoc. Severity is LOW (trivial accessors).
