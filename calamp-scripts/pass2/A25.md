- **Row count:** 1,234 data rows (excluding header)
- **Platform:** CI only (CalAmp Tracking Intelligence — `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`)
- **APN decoded:**
  - `2306,0` = `data.mono` (hex `646174612E6D6F6E6F00`)
  - `2306,1` = `data.mono` (hex `646174612E6D6F6E6F00`)
- **Primary server decoded:**
  - `2319,0` = `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (hex `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00`)
- **Secondary server decoded:**
  - `2320,0` = `dm.calamp.co.uk` (hex `646D2E63616C616D702E636F2E756B00`)
- **Port:**
  - `2311,0` = `0x5014` = **20500** (primary)
  - `2312,0` = `0x0011` = 17 (secondary/keepalive field)
- **Script type:** CI-only production script; points to production CI server

### FILE: `UK Script/161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`

- **Row count:** 1,234 data rows (excluding header)
- **Platform:** Rayven (primary server is the Rayven production IP)
- **APN decoded:**
  - `2306,0` = `data.mono` (hex `646174612E6D6F6E6F00`)
  - `2306,1` = `data.mono` (hex `646174612E6D6F6E6F00`)
- **Primary server decoded:**
  - `2319,0` = `52.164.241.179` (hex `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900`) — a raw IP address, not a hostname
- **Secondary server decoded:**
  - `2320,0` = `dm.calamp.co.uk` (hex `646D2E63616C616D702E636F2E756B00`)
- **Port:**
  - `2311,0` = `0x5014` = **20500** (same as 161.31)
- **Is 161.32 pointing to a demo/staging server or production?**
  Cross-referencing all 31 CSV files in the repository: `52.164.241.179` is used by every Rayven-platform production script across all regions (AU customers: Boaroo, CEA, Komatsu; US customers: Matthai, PAPE, SIE; also the standalone Demo Script `61.142`). There is no dedicated demo or staging IP in the entire repository. **161.32 points to the same Rayven production server as every other Rayven script.** The word "Demo" in the filename does not correspond to a dedicated demo server endpoint.

### Key Differences Between 161.31 and 161.32

Only **4 parameters differ** between the two 1,234-row files:

| Parameter | Index | 161.31 (CI only) | 161.32 (Rayven Demo) | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| `768` | 0 | `6704EB0F` | `34A4F1B3` | Calibration/configuration hash — different script identity |
| `769` | 0 | `2AF8` (=11000) | `05DF` (=1503) | Calibration register value |
| `1024` | 23 | `1F` (=31) | `20` (=32) | Single CANBUS/motion parameter byte |
| `2319` | 0 | `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` | `52.164.241.179` | Primary server — the only meaningful operational difference |

The APN, port, secondary server, all event rules (param 512), all I/O configuration, all timing parameters, and the PIN mask (`*****`) are **identical** between the two files. The only functionally meaningful difference is the primary reporting server (CI vs Rayven).

## Coverage Analysis

### Are these generic UK scripts or customer-specific?

Both scripts are **generic UK-region scripts** with no customer name in the filename or in any decoded string. They are carrier/platform variants for UK deployment, not tied to a specific customer. The secondary server `dm.calamp.co.uk` confirms these are intended for the UK market.

### Is a Rayven production (non-demo) UK script missing?

**Yes — this is a significant gap.** The file named `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` is the only Rayven-platform UK script. Despite the "Demo" label, it actually points to the Rayven production server (`52.164.241.179`). There is no separately named Rayven production UK script (analogous to how AU has distinct `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA` scripts for production use). This creates a naming ambiguity: operators may avoid using a "Demo" file for production deployments, or conversely may use it without realising it is a production-pointing script. A clearly named production Rayven UK script is absent.

### Is a UK alternative-carrier variant missing?

**Yes.** Both UK scripts use `data.mono` as the APN (Monogoto MVNO SIM). There is no UK script with an alternative carrier APN (e.g., Vodafone, EE, O2, or a Kore-equivalent for the UK). AU customers have carrier-split scripts (e.g., Telstra vs Monogoto variants for Komatsu and CEA). The UK has no equivalent carrier diversity. If a UK customer uses a carrier other than Monogoto/data.mono, no ready-made script exists.

### Is there a CI+Rayven clone combined script for UK?

**No.** AU customers (CEA, Komatsu) have combined scripts (e.g., `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telstra Final.csv`, `61.135 Rayven and CI clone Komatsu Data.mono Final.csv`) that configure devices to report to both CI and Rayven simultaneously. No such combined UK script exists.

### Is a blank-APN / pre-provisioning UK script missing?

**Yes.** The AU Keller customer has `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` — a pre-provisioning script where the APN is not set, allowing SIMs that self-provision to be configured before the APN is known. No blank-APN or pre-provisioning UK script exists. Both UK scripts hardcode `data.mono`. For UK deployments with non-Monogoto SIMs or SIM swap workflows, there is no pre-provisioning template.

### Is an LMU1220 or 8-bit UK script missing?

**Yes.** The repository contains 8-bit LMU1220 scripts in the `8bit Script/` directory (AU-region; e.g., `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-...`), and AU customer CEA has dedicated LMU1220 scripts (`50.131 LMU1220 units.csv`, `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv`). No UK-specific LMU1220 or 8-bit variant exists. If the UK customer base includes LMU1220 hardware (which uses 8-bit parameter encoding), the 16-bit scripts (161.x series) will not be compatible.

### How does 2-script UK coverage compare to AU customers?

AU customers typically have 4–6 scripts each:

- **CEA (AU):** 6 scripts — CI, Rayven, Rayven+CI clone (Telstra), Rayven+CI clone (Monogoto), LMU1220-CI, LMU1220-Rayven
- **Komatsu (AU):** 6 scripts — Rayven+CI clone (Telstra), Rayven+CI clone (Monogoto), RD Telstra, RD Monogoto (plus 2 via 69.x series)
- **DPWorld (AU):** 2 scripts — CI Telstra, CI Monogoto
- **Keller (AU):** 2 scripts — Rayven Demo Blank APN, Optimal

The UK region has only 2 scripts total (for all UK customers combined, not per-customer). The gap versus AU customer depth is:
- No combined CI+Rayven UK script
- No alternative carrier UK script
- No blank-APN UK pre-provisioning script
- No LMU1220/8-bit UK script
- Only one Rayven-platform script (misleadingly named "Demo")

Whether this gap is justified depends on whether the UK has only one customer/carrier. Given the generic naming (no customer name) and the presence of a CalAmp UK domain (`dm.calamp.co.uk`) as secondary server, these appear intended as regional templates. The 4-gap shortfall relative to AU depth is not justified by any evidence in the repository.

### 161.32 Demo label vs actual server endpoint

Confirmed: `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` points to `52.164.241.179`, which is the **same production Rayven server** used by every other Rayven script across AU, US, and UK regions. There is no dedicated demo or staging server anywhere in the repository. The "Demo" in the filename is a misnomer or historical artifact. Devices flashed with 161.32 will report to the live Rayven production backend.

## Findings

**A25-1** — HIGH: Missing Rayven production UK script; "Demo" label on only Rayven UK file is misleading

**Description:** `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` is the sole Rayven-platform script for the UK region, yet its filename contains "Demo." Cross-repository analysis confirms it points to the production Rayven server (`52.164.241.179`), identical to all production AU and US Rayven scripts. There is no separately named Rayven production UK script. An operator following normal naming conventions would expect a "Demo" file to point to a sandbox/staging environment and may either avoid using it for production deployments, or may provision production devices with it without recognising it reaches the live backend. Either outcome creates operational risk: mis-provisioned demo devices polluting production data, or production customers lacking a correctly labelled configuration script.

**Fix:** Rename `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` to `161.32 Rayven DataMono Final.csv` (remove "Demo"). If a true demo/staging variant is needed, create a separate `161.33 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` pointing to a dedicated staging server endpoint, and document that server in `URL & PORTS.xlsx`.

---

**A25-2** — MEDIUM: No combined CI+Rayven UK script

**Description:** AU customers (CEA, Komatsu) have combined scripts that configure devices to report to both the CI and Rayven platforms simultaneously (dual-reporting). No such combined script exists for the UK region. Any UK customer that requires dual-platform visibility cannot be provisioned without manual script creation.

**Fix:** Create `161.33 Rayven and CI clone DataMono Final.csv` for the UK region, modelled on `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA data Mono Final.csv`, using the UK APN (`data.mono`) and UK secondary server (`dm.calamp.co.uk`).

---

**A25-3** — MEDIUM: No alternative-carrier UK script

**Description:** Both UK scripts hardcode the Monogoto APN (`data.mono`). No script exists for UK deployments using Vodafone, EE, O2, or any other carrier. AU customers have carrier-split scripts (Telstra vs Monogoto). UK deployments with non-Monogoto SIMs have no ready-made configuration template.

**Fix:** Identify the secondary carrier(s) used in UK deployments. Create `161.34 CI only [CarrierName] Final.csv` and `161.35 Rayven [CarrierName] Final.csv` for each additional carrier, cloning the respective 161.31/161.32 base and substituting the correct APN string at parameter `2306,0` and `2306,1`.

---

**A25-4** — MEDIUM: No blank-APN / pre-provisioning UK script

**Description:** The AU Keller customer has a blank-APN pre-provisioning script (`61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`) for SIM swap and pre-staging workflows. No equivalent exists for the UK region. Both UK scripts hardcode `data.mono` at `2306,0`/`2306,1`. UK deployments involving SIM provisioning workflows, device staging before SIM assignment, or non-Monogoto SIMs have no pre-provisioning template.

**Fix:** Create `161.36 Rayven UK Blank APN.csv` by cloning 161.32, clearing `2306,0` and `2306,1` to `00` (null-terminated empty string). Document its intended use (pre-provisioning only, not for production deployment) in a README or the `URL & PORTS.xlsx` notes column.

---

**A25-5** — LOW: No LMU1220 / 8-bit UK script

**Description:** The repository contains 8-bit LMU1220 scripts in the `8bit Script/` directory and AU-specific LMU1220 variants for CEA. No UK equivalent exists. If any UK-deployed hardware uses the LMU1220 (which requires 8-bit parameter encoding), the 16-bit 161.x scripts are incompatible and will fail to configure the device correctly.

**Fix:** Determine whether LMU1220 units are deployed or planned for the UK. If so, create `50.161 UK CI LMU1220 DataMono.csv` and `50.162 UK Rayven LMU1220 DataMono.csv` based on the existing `8bit Script/` templates, with UK APN and server values substituted. If LMU1220 is not used in the UK, document this explicitly to prevent future confusion.

---

**A25-6** — LOW: 161.32 uses a raw IP address for primary server instead of a hostname

**Description:** `161.32` sets `2319,0` to the raw IP `52.164.241.179` rather than a DNS hostname. All CI scripts use the hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`. If the Rayven server IP changes (e.g., due to cloud provider migration or load balancer changes), all devices provisioned with 161.32 will stop reporting without any DNS-layer fallback. By contrast, hostname-based configurations can be updated at the DNS level without device reprovisioning.

**Fix:** Replace the raw IP `52.164.241.179` at `2319,0` in `161.32` with the canonical Rayven hostname (confirm the correct FQDN from Rayven documentation or the CalAmp `URL & PORTS.xlsx` file). Retest connectivity after the change. Apply the same fix to any other Rayven scripts in the repository that use the raw IP if a hostname is available.
