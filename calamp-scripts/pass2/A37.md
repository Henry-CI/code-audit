## Reading Evidence

**FILE:** `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/US Script/SIE/69.006 Rayven SIE Datamono Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1229 lines total (1228 data rows, 1 header)

**Platform:** Rayven / Datamono (inferred from filename, APN, and server address)

**APN decoded:**
- param 2306,0: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → `data.mono`
- param 2306,1: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → `data.mono`
- param 2307,0: `00` → (empty — no APN username set)

**Primary server decoded + port:**
- param 2319,0: `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → `52.164.241.179`
- param 2312,0: `0011` → port 17 (decimal; consistent with all other Rayven/Datamono scripts in the repo — this is the platform-specific UDP port)
- param 2313,0: `0000` → secondary port = 0 (not configured)

**Secondary server:** ABSENT — param 2320 is not present in this file. (PAPE 69.007 sets param 2320,0 to `dm.calamp.com`.)

**Internal version stamp:**
- param 1024,1: `45` = decimal 69 (firmware major generation)
- param 1024,23: `06` = decimal 6 (sub-version)
- Combined version stamp: **69.6** — matches the script filename `69.006`

**Carrier credentials:**
- param 2318,0: `2A323238393900` → `*22899` (carrier activation code / provisioning dial string)
- No Kore SIM credentials present (params 2308, 2309 absent; PAPE 69.007 sets these to `Kore` and `Kore123`)
- param 3331,0 (SMS passphrase): `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****`

**AT command string (param 2178,0):**
`3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` → `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` — identical in both SIE and PAPE.

**Comparison with PAPE 69.007 (same firmware generation — differences):**

| Parameter | SIE 69.006 | PAPE 69.007 | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1024,23 (sub-version) | 06 | 07 | PAPE is one revision ahead |
| 2306,0/1 (APN) | `data.mono` | `data641003` | Different carrier APN |
| 2308,0 (carrier name) | ABSENT | `Kore` | SIE has no Kore SIM config |
| 2309,0 (carrier PIN) | ABSENT | `Kore123` | SIE has no Kore SIM config |
| 2310,0 (carrier field) | ABSENT | `00000000` | SIE absent |
| 2311,0 (carrier field) | ABSENT | `5014` | SIE absent |
| 2314,0/1 (APN ctx2) | ABSENT | `dummy` | No secondary APN context |
| 2315,0/1 (APN user2) | ABSENT | `dummy` | No secondary APN user |
| 2316,0/1 (APN pass2) | ABSENT | `*99***1#` | No secondary APN pass |
| 2319,0 (primary server) | `52.164.241.179` | `52.164.241.179` | Identical |
| 2320,0 (secondary server) | ABSENT | `dm.calamp.com` | SIE has NO fallback server |
| 2322,0 (keepalive/heartbeat) | ABSENT | `00015180` = 86400 s (24h) | SIE missing heartbeat config |
| 769,0 (timing) | `05E4` = 1508 | `05DD` = 1501 | Minor timing difference |

The SIE script is clearly derived from the same firmware generation 69 template as PAPE 69.007, but SIE is at sub-version 6 (PAPE is at 7). SIE uses a Mono/Datamono SIM (`data.mono` APN, `*22899` activation) rather than a Kore SIM. Critical differences are the absence of secondary/fallback server (2320), secondary APN context (2314–2316), Kore SIM credentials (2308–2311), and heartbeat interval (2322).

## Coverage Analysis

**1. Carrier variants missing (Kore/Pod equivalent):**
SIE has only one script using a Datamono SIM (`data.mono` APN). There is no Kore-SIM variant for SIE. PAPE has both a Datamono variant (62.x series) and a Kore/Pod variant (69.007). SIE lacks this dual-carrier coverage entirely. If the carrier or SIM type changes — which is routine in US fleet deployments — there is no ready alternative script.

**2. CI-only SIE script:**
None. PAPE has a dedicated CI-only script (`62.134 Rayven CI PAPE Final Datamono.csv`). SIE has no CI-only equivalent. If SIE devices are ever deployed with CalAmp Intelligent (CI) features active, there is no tested, customer-specific CI script.

**3. Rayven+CI combined script:**
None. Several other US customers have Rayven+CI combined scripts. SIE does not.

**4. Demo or pre-provisioning SIE script:**
None. The UK customer (161.32) has a dedicated Demo script. The Australian Keller customer has a Demo/Blank-APN script (61.101). SIE has no demo or blank-APN provisioning script. This means any initial device staging for SIE must repurpose another customer's demo script or the single production script, creating a risk of misconfiguration during pre-deployment.

**5. Version consistency with PAPE 69.007:**
Yes — both share firmware generation 69. SIE is at sub-version 6 and PAPE is at sub-version 7. They share the same 512-series event table, the same 1024 firmware configuration block (except sub-version byte), and the same primary server IP. SIE appears to be a slightly earlier snapshot of the same template, never updated to the sub-version 7 refinements present in PAPE 69.007.

**6. Complete deployment or under-provisioned:**
Under-provisioned. The minimum acceptable script set for a US production customer in this repository's pattern is: (a) a Datamono/Mono variant, (b) a Kore/Pod variant, and (c) ideally a CI variant. SIE has only (a). Combined with the missing secondary server (dm.calamp.com) and missing heartbeat parameter (2322), the single script is itself also less robust than its PAPE counterpart.

**7. Secondary/fallback server:**
ABSENT. Param 2320 (secondary server) is not set. PAPE 69.007 configures `dm.calamp.com` as fallback. If the primary server (52.164.241.179) becomes unreachable, SIE devices have no fallback path — they will go dark without any recovery mechanism until manually re-provisioned.

**8. Comparison with other single-script customers (Boaroo AUS, UK 161.31):**
- **Boaroo (AUS):** One script (`69.005 Rayven Boaroo Telstra Final.csv`). Single-carrier (Telstra), no Pod/Kore variant — a similar single-script coverage gap but on a different continent and carrier ecosystem.
- **UK 161.31:** One CI-only script (`161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv`). The UK directory also has a Demo script (161.32), giving UK two scripts for partial coverage. UK is better covered than SIE despite both being small-footprint customers.
- **SIE pattern:** Comparable to Boaroo in having a single carrier variant with no fallback, but worse than UK because there is no demo script at all. SIE is the most under-covered US customer — a single Datamono production script with no carrier variant, no CI variant, no demo script, and a missing fallback server configuration.

## Findings

**A37-1** — HIGH: Missing secondary/fallback server configuration

**Description:** Param 2320 (secondary server address) is absent in the SIE script. The equivalent PAPE 69.007 script configures `dm.calamp.com` as the secondary server. Without a fallback, any SIE device will go permanently dark if the primary server IP `52.164.241.179` becomes unreachable. There is no automatic reconnection path.

**Fix:** Add `2320,0` set to the same fallback value used in PAPE 69.007 (`646D2E63616C616D702E636F6D00` = `dm.calamp.com`). Also add `2322,0` heartbeat interval (`00015180` = 86400 s) to match the PAPE 69.007 sub-version 7 baseline. Increment the sub-version stamp (1024,23) from `06` to `07` to reflect the update.

---

**A37-2** — HIGH: No Kore/Pod SIM variant script for SIE

**Description:** SIE has only a Datamono SIM script. Every other US production customer in the repository (PAPE, Matthai) has at least one alternative carrier variant (Kore, Pod). If SIE devices require re-SIM'd with a Kore card — due to Datamono coverage issues, carrier pricing changes, or device replacement — there is no ready SIE-specific script. Engineers would have to adapt the generic PAPE Kore script, risking incorrect APN, server, or event configuration for the SIE deployment profile.

**Fix:** Create `69.008 Rayven SIE Kore Final.csv` (or equivalent) by adapting PAPE 69.007 with SIE-specific event table and configuration, substituting the Kore SIM credentials (params 2308–2311) and updating the APN to the Kore APN used in PAPE 69.007 (`data641003`). Retain the SIE primary server and add the secondary server fix from A37-1.

---

**A37-3** — MEDIUM: No CI-only or Rayven+CI script for SIE

**Description:** PAPE has a dedicated CI-only script (`62.134`) and a combined Rayven+CI Datamono script. SIE has neither. If SIE ever enables CalAmp Intelligent features (asset tracking analytics, geofence events, or CI-specific reporting), there is no customer-specific CI script to deploy. Deploying the PAPE CI script to SIE devices would push incorrect server/APN configuration.

**Fix:** Create a `69.009 Rayven CI SIE Datamono Final.csv` by adapting `62.134 Rayven CI PAPE Final Datamono.csv` with SIE's server address, APN (`data.mono`), and carrier credentials, updated to firmware generation 69.

---

**A37-4** — MEDIUM: No demo or blank-APN provisioning script for SIE

**Description:** There is no SIE-specific demo or pre-provisioning script. Comparable customers have dedicated blank-APN/demo scripts (Keller: `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`; UK: `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`). Pre-deployment staging of SIE devices currently requires repurposing another customer's demo script, which may have incorrect event tables, server addresses, or I/O configurations for SIE hardware.

**Fix:** Create `69.010 Rayven SIE Demo Blank APN.csv` derived from the SIE production script with APN fields zeroed/blanked and server set to a staging endpoint. This script should be used for initial device power-up, SIM validation, and staging before the production script is applied.

---

**A37-5** — LOW: Sub-version lag — SIE script not updated to match PAPE 69.007 baseline

**Description:** The SIE script is at internal sub-version 6 (1024,23 = `06`) while PAPE 69.007 is at sub-version 7 (1024,23 = `07`). The PAPE update to sub-version 7 added: secondary server (2320), heartbeat interval (2322), and Kore SIM credential params (2308–2311). The SIE script was never brought forward to incorporate the sub-version 7 improvements. Even setting aside the Kore-specific additions, the secondary server and heartbeat fixes in sub-version 7 are applicable to SIE and have not been backported.

**Fix:** Apply the non-Kore improvements from sub-version 7 (params 2320, 2322, and updated timing in 769,0) to the SIE Datamono script and increment 1024,23 to `07`. Track version parity between SIE and PAPE as a baseline maintenance requirement.
