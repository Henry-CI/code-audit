## Reading Evidence

### FILE: `Aus Script/CEA/50.131 LMU1220 units.csv`

**Row count:** 319 total (318 data rows + 1 header)

**Purpose:** LMU1220 hardware provisioning script for CEA standard (CI-only) units. The 50.x prefix denotes LMU1220-specific provisioning; this file targets the non-Rayven device population. Carrier: Telstra (APN `*22899`). Platform: Tracking Intelligence / NARHM.

**APN, server, port:**
- param 2318,0 = `2A323238393900` → decoded: `*22899` (Telstra APN)
- param 2319,0 = `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` → decoded: `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (primary server, FQDN)
- param 2319,1 = `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → decoded: `52.164.241.179` (secondary server, IP fallback)
- param 2311,0 = `5014` → decoded: port `20500` (0x5014)
- param 2312,0 = `0011` → protocol identifier 17

**Key differences from other files in this batch:**
- Primary server (2319,0) uses the **FQDN** `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`, unlike 50.132 which uses the IP address as primary.
- param 769,0 = `0x2AF8` = 11000 (differs from 50.132 where 769,0 = `0x05E0` = 1504); this likely reflects a different sleep/wakeup interval tuned for the CI (non-Rayven) device.
- param 1024,23 = `0x83` (differs from 50.132 = `0x84`); this byte controls an input/output configuration setting.
- No param 2308/2309 (carrier credential fields absent); no param 2178 (no EA/tag field).
- No param 2306 (no secondary APN list); this is a Telstra-only script.
- 318 data rows — identical row count to 50.132; both are compact LMU1220 provisioning scripts.

### FILE: `Aus Script/CEA/50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv`

**Row count:** 319 total (318 data rows + 1 header)

**Purpose:** LMU1220 hardware provisioning script for CEA Rayven-platform units. The `Rayven` name in the filename indicates the target device feeds into the Rayven telematics platform rather than the standard CI dashboard. Carrier: Telstra (APN `*22899`). Platform: Rayven.

**APN, server, port:**
- param 2318,0 = `2A323238393900` → decoded: `*22899` (Telstra APN — same as 50.131)
- param 2319,0 = `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → decoded: `52.164.241.179` (primary server, IP — direct IP, no FQDN)
- param 2319,1 = `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → decoded: `52.164.241.179` (secondary server — same IP repeated)
- param 2311,0 = `5014` → port `20500` (same as 50.131)
- param 2312,0 = `0011` → protocol identifier 17 (same as 50.131)

**Key differences from other files in this batch:**
- Primary server (2319,0) uses the **IP address** `52.164.241.179` directly (both primary and secondary are the same IP), unlike 50.131 which uses the FQDN as primary. This is significant: if the IP address behind `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` changes, 50.132 will not follow the DNS update.
- param 769,0 = `0x05E0` = 1504 (differs from 50.131 = 11000); indicates a different wake/heartbeat interval appropriate for Rayven-attached devices.
- param 1024,23 = `0x84` (differs from 50.131 = `0x83`); one-bit difference in an input/IO configuration byte.
- No param 2308/2309/2178/2306 (same absence as 50.131; these 50.x scripts are intentionally minimal provisioning scripts).

### FILE: `Aus Script/CEA/61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telsta Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1230 total (1229 data rows + 1 header)

**Purpose:** Full operational configuration script for CEA devices on both Rayven and CI (clone) platforms, Telstra carrier. The 61.x prefix denotes the standard (non-LMU1220-specific) script format; this file is significantly larger than the 50.x scripts, covering a full parameter set including I/O routing (param 512/513/515 — hundreds of event-action table entries), peripheral config (params 3072–3333), and Rayven-platform identifiers.

**APN, server, port:**
- param 2178,0 = `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` → decoded: `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` (EA/slot/tag selector string for Rayven platform identification)
- param 2308,0 = `4B6F726500` → decoded: `Kore` (carrier credential name)
- param 2309,0 = `4B6F726531323300` → decoded: `Kore123` (carrier credential / APN password)
- param 2318,0 = `2A323238393900` → decoded: `*22899` (Telstra APN — same as 50.x scripts)
- param 2319,0 = `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` → decoded: `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (primary server, FQDN — same as 50.131)
- param 2319,1 = `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → decoded: `52.164.241.179` (secondary server, IP fallback)
- param 3331,0 = `2A2A2A2A2A00` → decoded: `*****` (password field, stored obfuscated)
- Port: no explicit 2311 param present; port is embedded in the platform configuration rather than set as a standalone parameter (consistent with other 61.x scripts in this repo).

**Key differences from other files in this batch:**
- 1229 data rows vs 318 in the 50.x files: the 61.x format is a complete full-parameter configuration vs the 50.x minimal provisioning format.
- Contains the full event-action table (params 512, 513, 515 — hundreds of entries); the 50.x scripts contain a much shorter 512-table.
- Contains Rayven/peripheral params (3072–3333) absent entirely from 50.x scripts.
- param 2178 EA-tag string present (Rayven platform slot selector); absent in 50.x scripts.
- param 2308/2309 (Kore carrier credentials) present; absent in 50.x scripts.
- param 3331 (password) present; absent in 50.x scripts.
- param 1024,23 = `0x8C` (vs 50.131=0x83, 50.132=0x84); this byte has a different value in 61.x scripts, consistent with the different firmware parameter set for standard vs LMU1220 hardware.
- Filename contains the typo `Telsta` instead of `Telstra` (see Finding A06-1).

## Coverage Analysis

### 50.131 vs 50.132: LMU1220 provisioning pairing

These two files form a correct and complete pair for the LMU1220 device population:
- **50.131** targets CI-platform (non-Rayven) LMU1220 units, using the FQDN as the primary server endpoint.
- **50.132** targets Rayven-platform LMU1220 units, using the IP address directly as both primary and secondary server endpoint.

The pairing is complete for the Telstra carrier. The parameter-level differences (769,0 heartbeat interval; 1024,23 IO config byte; 2319,0 server address format) are appropriate for their respective target platforms. Both correctly use APN `*22899` (Telstra).

### Is there a 50.x Monogoto/DataMono variant?

No. There is no `50.x` DataMono or Monogoto provisioning script for CEA anywhere in the repository. Only 50.131 (CI) and 50.132 (Rayven) exist, both Telstra-only. For context: no other customer in the repository has a 50.x DataMono variant either — the 50.x LMU1220 provisioning scripts are consistently Telstra-only across all customers. This pattern appears intentional: LMU1220 units at CEA use Telstra SIMs for provisioning. A DataMono 50.x variant is not structurally required if all LMU1220 devices ship with Telstra SIMs.

**Coverage verdict:** No gap identified for the 50.x Monogoto variant — the absence is consistent with the pattern across the repo.

### 61.140 (Telstra) and 61.141 (DataMono) pairing

The Telstra/DataMono pair is present and correctly structured:
- **61.140** is the Telstra variant: APN `*22899`, no param 2306.
- **61.141** (assigned to A09) is the DataMono variant: APN `*22899` as primary, plus param 2306 = `data.mono` (indices 0 and 1) as the Monogoto/DataMono APN list. The single meaningful diff between the two files is the addition of 2306 in 61.141 and a one-bit change in param 1024,23 (`0x8C` vs `0x8D`). This matches the exact same Telstra-vs-Mono differentiation pattern used in other customers (Komatsu 61.133/61.135, DPWorld 61.36/61.37).

**Coverage verdict:** The 61.140/61.141 pair is complete and correctly differentiated.

### Blank-APN / pre-provisioning script for CEA

No blank-APN or demo/pre-provisioning script exists within the CEA subfolder. The broader repository has a `Keller/61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` and a `Demo Script/61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv`, but these are for other customers. There is no CEA-specific equivalent.

**Coverage verdict:** Missing — no blank-APN or pre-provisioning script for CEA (see Finding A06-2).

### Filename typo "Telsta" in 61.140

The file `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telsta Final.csv` contains the misspelling `Telsta` where `Telstra` is intended. The equivalent Komatsu file is correctly named `61.133 Rayven and CI clone Komatsu Telstra Final.csv`. The 69.003 sibling in the same CEA folder is correctly named `69.003 RD CEA Telstra Final.csv`.

**Risk:** The typo is in the filename only; the file contents are correctly configured for Telstra (APN `*22899`). However, a wrongly-named file creates risk of selecting the wrong script when searching or filtering by carrier name, and raises a process quality concern.

### 50.x vs 61.x hardware coverage

The 50.x scripts (50.131, 50.132) target **LMU1220** hardware (special provisioning format, shorter parameter set, explicit port param 2311). The 61.x scripts (61.140, 61.141) target **standard tracker** hardware (full parameter set, event-action table with 200+ entries, Rayven peripheral params 3072–3333). These are different hardware models and both sets are present. The 69.x scripts (69.003, 69.004) appear to be a third variant (RD = Remote Diagnostics or a different platform).

**Coverage verdict:** The CEA folder provides all three hardware/platform tiers: 50.x (LMU1220), 61.x (standard), 69.x (RD variant). Coverage is complete across hardware models.

### Overall carrier coverage matrix for CEA

| Script type      | Telstra | DataMono/Monogoto |
|------------------|---------|-------------------|
| 50.x LMU1220 CI  | 50.131  | (none — intentional, Telstra SIMs only for LMU1220) |
| 50.x LMU1220 Rayven | 50.132 | (none — same reason) |
| 61.x standard    | 61.140  | 61.141 |
| 69.x RD          | 69.003  | 69.004 |

The matrix is complete for the 61.x and 69.x tiers. The absence of DataMono 50.x variants is consistent with the repo-wide pattern and not a gap.

## Findings

**A06-1** — LOW: Filename typo "Telsta" instead of "Telstra" in 61.140

**Description:** The file `Aus Script/CEA/61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telsta Final.csv` misspells "Telstra" as "Telsta". All other Telstra-targeted files in the repository spell the carrier name correctly (e.g., `61.133 Rayven and CI clone Komatsu Telstra Final.csv`, `69.003 RD CEA Telstra Final.csv`). The contents of the file are correct for Telstra; the issue is filename-only. The typo creates risk of incorrect script selection when operators filter or search by carrier name, and indicates a quality gap in the file-naming review process.

**Fix:** Rename the file to `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telstra Final.csv`. Update any deployment documentation, dashboards, or tooling that references the filename directly. Verify via git history whether the file was delivered to customers under this name and, if so, notify the relevant team to update their records.

---

**A06-2** — LOW: No blank-APN / pre-provisioning script for CEA

**Description:** The CEA subfolder contains no blank-APN or demo/pre-provisioning script. The Keller subfolder provides `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` for this purpose, and a general `Demo Script/61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` exists at repo root, but neither is CEA-specific. Without a pre-provisioning script, technicians provisioning fresh LMU1220 or standard tracker units for CEA must either adapt a script from another customer or use a generic repo-level script, creating risk of misconfiguration (wrong server endpoint, wrong APN, wrong event table) being applied to CEA hardware.

**Fix:** Create a CEA-specific blank-APN / pre-provisioning script following the pattern of `Keller/61.101`. This script should set the server and port parameters to CEA values (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`, port 20500) but leave the APN field blank (or set to a safe placeholder), so devices can connect to the provisioning infrastructure before the final carrier SIM is inserted.

---

**A06-3** — LOW: 50.132 uses IP address as primary server; no FQDN fallback

**Description:** In `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv`, both the primary and secondary server parameters (2319,0 and 2319,1) are set to the same IP address `52.164.241.179`. By contrast, `50.131` uses the FQDN `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` as primary and `52.164.241.179` as IP fallback, which is the more resilient pattern. In 50.132, if the IP address changes (e.g., cloud infrastructure migration), devices will lose connectivity and the FQDN will not be consulted because it is not configured. The secondary endpoint offers no additional resilience since it is identical to the primary.

**Fix:** Update `50.132` param 2319,0 to `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (FQDN, matching 50.131 and 61.140) and retain `52.164.241.179` as the 2319,1 IP fallback. This aligns the Rayven provisioning script with the FQDN-primary pattern used by all other CEA scripts.
