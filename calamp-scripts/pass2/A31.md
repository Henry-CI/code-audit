## Reading Evidence

### FILE: `US Script/PAPE/62.134 Rayven CI PAPE Final Datamono.csv`

**Row count:** 1,229 data rows (excluding header)

**Platform:** CalAmp LMU GPS device -- CSV parameter script

**APN + carrier credentials:**
- Parameter 2306,0 and 2306,1 (APN): `data.mono` (decoded from hex `646174612E6D6F6E6F00`)
- Parameters 2308 (APN username) and 2309 (APN password): **not present** in this file
- Parameters 2314 (dummy username), 2315 (dummy password), 2316 (SIM PIN): **not present**
- This file uses the Datamono carrier APN only, with no explicit username/password credentials

**Server + port:**
- Parameter 2319,0 (primary server): `52.164.241.179` (decoded from hex `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900`)
- Parameter 2319,1 (secondary server): `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (decoded from hex `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00`)
- Parameter 2318,0 (phone/SMS number): `*22899`
- Parameter 768,0 (server IP binding slot 0): `52.164.241.179`
- Parameter 768,1 (server IP binding slot 1): `103.4.235.15` (decoded from hex `6704EB0F`)
- Parameter 769,0 (port slot 0): 1501 (0x05DD)
- Parameter 769,1 (port slot 1): 11000 (0x2AF8)
- Parameter 769,2 and 769,3: 20500 (0x5014)
- Parameter 2312,0: 0x0011 = 17 (appears to be a protocol/type code, not a primary port)

**EA tag (param 2178,0):** `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` -- standard Rayven/CalAmp messaging tag, identical across all three files.

**What 62.134 is:** The original "CI" (pre-production or carrier-integration) PAPE script for Datamono. "CI" in the filename distinguishes this as a carrier-integration variant. Uses `data.mono` APN, no SIM PIN or APN credentials. Has a secondary hostname (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) and a secondary IP (103.4.235.15) at port 11000 which is absent in 62.200.

**Internal version marker (param 1024,23):** `0x86` = decimal 134, matching the `.134` script suffix.

### FILE: `US Script/PAPE/62.137 Rayven CI PAPE Final Pod.csv`

**Row count:** 1,237 data rows

**Platform:** CalAmp LMU GPS device -- CSV parameter script

**APN + carrier credentials:**
- Parameter 2306,0 and 2306,1 (APN): `data641003` (decoded from hex `6461746136343130303300`)

- Parameter 2316,0 and 2316,1 (SIM PIN dial string): `*99***1#` (decoded from hex `2A39392A2A2A312300`)
- This file uses the Kore IoT carrier (APN `data641003`) with username/password and SIM PIN

**Server + port:**
- Parameter 2319,0 (primary server): `52.164.241.179`
- Parameter 2319,1 (secondary server): `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`
- Parameter 2318,0 (phone): `*22899`
- Parameter 768,0: `52.164.241.179`
- Parameter 768,1: `103.4.235.15`
- Parameter 769,0: 1501; Parameter 769,1: 11000; Parameters 769,2/769,3: 20500

**Internal version marker (param 1024,23):** `0x89` = decimal 137, matching `.137`.

**What 62.137 is:** The "Pod" variant paired with 62.134. "Pod" denotes the Kore IoT SIM carrier. Uses `data641003` APN with Kore credentials and SIM PIN dial string. Has the same secondary server hostname as 62.134. This is the carrier-pair partner to 62.134 (Datamono vs Pod).

### FILE: `US Script/PAPE/62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv`

**Row count:** 1,236 data rows

**Platform:** CalAmp LMU GPS device -- CSV parameter script

**APN + carrier credentials:**
- Parameter 2306,0 and 2306,1 (APN): `data641003` (Kore APN -- **not** Datamono; see analysis below)
- Parameter 2308,0 (APN username): `Kore`
- Parameter 2309,0 (APN password): `Kore123`
- Parameter 2314,0 and 2314,1: `dummy`
- Parameter 2315,0 and 2315,1: `dummy`
- Parameter 2316,0 and 2316,1 (SIM PIN): `*99***1#`

**Server + port:**
- Parameter 2319,0 (primary server): `52.164.241.179`
- Parameter 2319,1 (secondary server): **absent** (removed relative to 62.134 and 62.137)
- Parameter 2318,0 (phone): `*22899`
- Parameter 768,0: `52.164.241.179`
- Parameter 768,1: `0.0.0.0` (zeroed out; 103.4.235.15 was cleared)
- Parameter 769,0: 1501; Parameter 769,1: 20500 (was 11000 in 62.134/137); Parameters 769,2/769,3: 20500

**Internal version marker (param 1024,23):** `0xC8` = decimal 200, matching `.200`.

**What "Fixed" means for 62.200 vs 62.134 -- what actually changed:**

14 parameter rows differ between 62.134 and 62.200. The changes break into four categories:

1. **APN switched from Datamono to Kore:** `data.mono` replaced by `data641003`; APN credentials (2308, 2309) and SIM PIN entries (2314, 2315, 2316) added. Despite the filename saying "Datamono Fixed", the actual APN configured is the Kore/Pod APN (`data641003`). This is almost certainly a naming error -- the file was produced by editing 62.137 (Pod) rather than 62.134 (Datamono).

2. **Secondary server and secondary IP removed/zeroed:** Parameter 2319,1 (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) was removed. Parameter 768,1 was zeroed from `103.4.235.15` to `0.0.0.0`.

3. **Secondary port slot changed:** Parameter 769,1 changed from 11000 (0x2AF8) to 20500 (0x5014), aligning with the primary port used in 769,2 and 769,3.

4. **Internal version stamp updated:** 1024,23 changed from 0x86 (134) to 0xC8 (200), correctly stamping the version number.

The "fix" therefore consists of: removing the secondary hostname server entry, clearing a secondary IP binding, and normalizing the port. However, the APN and carrier credentials in 62.200 are Kore credentials, not Datamono, making the "Datamono Fixed" label misleading or incorrect.

## Coverage Analysis

### 62.134 (Datamono) vs 62.137 (Pod) -- carrier variant pair

Yes, 62.134 and 62.137 form a carrier variant pair:
- Both are marked "CI" (carrier-integration / pre-production) and "Final"
- Both use the same server IP (52.164.241.179), same secondary server (narhm.tracking-intelligence.com), same phone number (*22899), same port slots
- The only substantive differences are the APN and carrier credentials: 62.134 uses `data.mono` with no credentials, 62.137 uses `data641003` with Kore username/password and SIM PIN
- 11 rows differ; the diff is confined entirely to carrier-connectivity parameters (2306, 2308, 2309, 2314, 2315, 2316) and the internal version stamp (1024,23)

### 62.200 ("Datamono Fixed") -- what was fixed and naming accuracy

62.200 is positioned as the corrected follow-on to 62.134 but contains the Kore APN (`data641003`), not the Datamono APN (`data.mono`). The most likely explanation is that 62.200 was derived from 62.137 (Pod), not 62.134 (Datamono), and was renamed "Datamono Fixed" in error -- or "Datamono Fixed" refers to some other dimension (fixing the secondary server entry) rather than the carrier type.

The substantive fixes applied in 62.200 relative to 62.134/62.137:
- Removal of the secondary hostname (2319,1: `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`)
- Zeroing of the secondary IP binding (768,1)
- Normalization of the secondary port slot to 20500 (matching primary port)

### Is there a "Pod Fixed" counterpart to 62.200?

Yes, 62.371 (assigned to A34) serves this role within the 62.x generation. The naming pattern is:
- 62.134 Datamono (CI) -- original Datamono
- 62.137 Pod (CI) -- original Pod
- 62.200 Datamono Fixed -- actually carries Kore/Pod credentials (naming inconsistency noted)
- 62.371 Pod Fixed -- A34's scope

Given that 62.200 contains Pod/Kore APN credentials rather than Datamono credentials, 62.200 and 62.371 may both be Pod variants, leaving the true "Datamono Fixed" uncreated or mislabeled.

### Is there a CI-only PAPE script (without Rayven)?

No. All six PAPE files in the repository include "Rayven" in their filenames and contain the Rayven EA messaging tag (param 2178,0 = `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`). There is no Rayven-absent or plain CalAmp PAPE script in this folder.

### Is there a demo or pre-provisioning PAPE script?

No demo or pre-provisioning PAPE script exists in `US Script/PAPE/`. The broader repository contains a `Demo Script` folder in `US Script/`, but it is not represented in PAPE.

### Version history evolutionary chain (62.x -> 63.x -> 69.x)

The PAPE set spans three major version prefix families:
- **62.x** (four files): 62.134, 62.137, 62.200, 62.371 -- the Rayven CI and "Fixed" generation
- **63.x** (one file, A34): 63.137 -- a single Pod variant, presumably a further fix to 62.137/62.371
- **69.x** (one file, A34): 69.007 Final POD SIMcard -- the terminal or most recent Pod variant

The numeric suffixes within each family (134, 137, 200, 371) correspond to internal version stamps embedded in parameter 1024,23 (confirmed for 134, 137, 200). The evolutionary direction is: CI originals (62.134/62.137) -> Fixed (62.200/62.371) -> further Pod revision (63.137) -> final SIMcard Pod (69.007). The Datamono lineage is less clear; only 62.134 is definitively Datamono, and the supposed Datamono Fixed (62.200) carries Kore credentials.

### Is 62.134 still in active use, or superseded by 62.200?

Based on the version progression, 62.134 appears to have been superseded by 62.200 (or its true Datamono Fixed equivalent). The "CI" label on 62.134 and 62.137 typically indicates a pre-production or carrier-integration build; "Final" without "CI" (as on 62.200) suggests the later production build. However, 62.134 remains in the repository without a deletion notice or deprecation marker. If devices are still provisioned against 62.134, they will use `data.mono` APN without credentials, lack the SIM PIN entry, and retain the secondary hostname and secondary IP that were removed in 62.200.

## Findings

**A31-1** -- HIGH: Filename "62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed" contains Kore/Pod APN credentials, not Datamono

**Description:** File `62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv` is named as a Datamono variant but configures the Kore IoT carrier APN (`data641003`) with Kore username and password. The actual Datamono APN (`data.mono`) present in 62.134 is absent. This indicates the file was derived from the Pod script (62.137) rather than the Datamono script (62.134), making the "Datamono Fixed" label incorrect. Any device provisioned with 62.200 expecting Datamono connectivity will instead attempt to register on the Kore network, which will fail if the device SIM is a Datamono SIM.

**Fix:** Audit which SIM type is deployed with 62.200 in production. If Datamono SIMs are being provisioned against this script, create a true Datamono Fixed script by deriving from 62.134 (not 62.137) and applying only the server/port cleanup changes (clear 2319,1, zero 768,1, normalize 769,1 to 20500). Rename 62.200 or add a comment header to clarify it is a Kore/Pod script.

---

**A31-2** -- MEDIUM: 62.134 lacks APN username/password and SIM PIN entries present in all other PAPE files

**Description:** File `62.134 Rayven CI PAPE Final Datamono.csv` does not configure parameters 2308 (APN username), 2309 (APN password), 2314 (dummy username), 2315 (dummy password), or 2316 (SIM PIN dial string). All other PAPE files in the set (62.137, 62.200, and presumably 62.371, 63.137, 69.007) include these parameters. The Datamono APN (`data.mono`) may not require credentials, but the absence of the SIM PIN dial string (2316 = `*99***1#`) is a structural inconsistency. If these parameters were intentionally omitted for Datamono this should be documented; if the carrier was later found to require them, 62.134 is defective.

**Fix:** Confirm with the Datamono carrier whether APN credentials and SIM PIN are required. If required, add 2308, 2309, 2314, 2315, 2316 to 62.134 (or its Fixed successor). If not required, add a comment or README note documenting the intentional omission.

---

**A31-3** -- MEDIUM: Secondary server hostname (2319,1) and secondary IP (768,1) removed in 62.200 without explanation

**Description:** In 62.134 and 62.137, parameter 2319,1 is set to `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` and parameter 768,1 is `103.4.235.15` (port 11000). In 62.200 both entries are removed/zeroed. The removal of a secondary failover server represents a reduction in connectivity resilience. There is no comment, change log, or README in the repository explaining why the secondary server was removed or whether it was decommissioned, a staging address, or a misconfiguration.

**Fix:** Document the reason for removing the secondary server. If `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` / `103.4.235.15:11000` is a valid Rayven failover endpoint, restore it in the Fixed scripts. If it was removed deliberately (server decommissioned, staging-only), add a change log note to the PAPE folder.

---

**A31-4** -- LOW: No true "Datamono Fixed" production script exists in the repository

**Description:** The PAPE coverage set contains a CI Datamono script (62.134) but no confirmed production-ready Datamono Fixed counterpart (62.200 carries Kore credentials -- see A31-1). The Pod lineage has at least three versions (62.137, 62.371, 63.137, 69.007), while the Datamono lineage has only 62.134, which is marked "CI". If Datamono SIM cards are in active deployment, they may be provisioned against the CI-grade script or the incorrectly labeled 62.200.

**Fix:** Create a correctly configured Datamono Fixed script by starting from 62.134, applying the server cleanup (remove 2319,1, zero 768,1, normalize 769,1), retaining the `data.mono` APN (2306), and updating the internal version stamp (1024,23). Store as a clearly labeled file such as `62.XXX Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv`.

---

**A31-5** -- LOW: Parameter 1024,23 encodes the script version number as a binary byte, creating an implicit dependency between filename and file content

**Description:** Parameter 1024,23 contains the decimal value of the script's numeric suffix: 62.134 contains 0x86 (134), 62.137 contains 0x89 (137), 62.200 contains 0xC8 (200). This means if a script is copied and renumbered without updating this parameter, a version mismatch will exist between the filename and the embedded identifier. There is no validation mechanism in the repository (no test scripts, no CI checks) to detect such a mismatch.

**Fix:** Add a validation step or pre-provisioning checklist item confirming that the decimal value of 1024,23 matches the numeric suffix in the filename. When creating new scripts by copying an existing one, update 1024,23 as part of the renaming procedure.
