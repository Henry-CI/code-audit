## Reading Evidence

### FILE 1 (base):
`8bit Script/50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10.csv`

**Format:** Three-column CSV with header `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`. Values are hexadecimal. String parameters are null-terminated hex byte strings.

**Row count:** 328 data rows (329 lines including header).

**Device model and protocol variant:** CalAmp LMU1220 in 8-bit protocol mode (POD variant — Power-On/Off Detection). The filename encodes the configuration intent:
- `8bit` — 8-bit CalAmp PEG protocol (distinct from the 61.x series that use the standard protocol)
- `LMU1220` — CalAmp LMU1220 hardware
- `POD` — Power-On/Off Detection enabled
- `10minSleep6hr` — 10-minute sleep interval with a 6-hour outer sleep cycle
- `Input1POS` — Input 1 configured for POS (Position/Ignition)
- `PwrMonEvt` — Power Monitor Event enabled
- `PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10` — PEG rule 0: Motion event with acceleration threshold 4, distance threshold 500, debounce/threshold 10

**Key parameters decoded:**

| 2307 | 0 | `00` | 0 | PAP/CHAP auth mode = none |

**APN:** `data641003` — this is a Telstra (Australia) APN. The APN string `data641003` is a well-known Telstra IoT/M2M APN. No Monogoto or Kore equivalent is present.

**Servers:** `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (primary, port 20500) and `maint.vehicle-location.com` (secondary). These are the same endpoints used across most scripts in the Aus Script folder.

### FILE 2 (copy):
`8bit Script/50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10 (1).csv`

**Format:** Identical — three-column CSV, same headers.

**Row count:** 328 data rows (329 lines including header).

**Device model and protocol variant:** Same as File 1 — LMU1220, 8-bit protocol, POD, Telstra APN.

**Key parameters configured:** Identical in every field to File 1.

**Differences from File 1:** None. `diff` returns exit code 0 (no differences). MD5 checksums are identical for both files:

```
467274dffe7985e2d375d5bb18aca6df  ...Thes10.csv
467274dffe7985e2d375d5bb18aca6df  ...Thes10 (1).csv
```

The `(1)` suffix is a Windows Explorer duplicate-copy artifact. Both files were introduced in the same commit (`678d0d4 New Scripts added`) with no recorded distinction.

## Coverage Analysis

### Carrier variant coverage

The `8bit Script` folder contains exactly two files, both targeting a single carrier — Telstra (APN `data641003`). There are no 8-bit script variants for:

- **Monogoto** (used widely in the Aus Script/61.x series, e.g., `61.141`, `61.37`, `61.135`)
- **Kore** (used in US scripts, e.g., `61.139`)
- **DataMono / data.mono** (used in UK, US, and some Aus scripts)
- **Any other carrier**

In contrast, the 61.x production scripts in other folders consistently provide Telstra and Monogoto (or DataMono) pairs, confirming that carrier-variant pairing is the established pattern. The 8-bit script folder is a singleton in carrier coverage.

### Demo or test variant

There is no demo or test variant of this 8-bit script. The `Demo Script` folder in the repository contains only `61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` — a 61.x format script, not an 8-bit variant. No script with names including `demo`, `test`, `staging`, or `blank` exists within the `8bit Script` folder or referencing 8-bit devices elsewhere in the repository.

### Edge-condition coverage

No edge-condition scripts exist for the 8-bit device configuration:

- No script with a minimal (short) sleep interval for rapid testing (e.g., 1-minute sleep instead of 10-minute/6-hour)
- No script with events disabled (all-zero PEG table) to serve as a baseline/factory-reset reference
- No script with a blank or placeholder APN to support devices before SIM provisioning
- No script with alternative distance or acceleration thresholds
- No script exercising the maximum or minimum heartbeat intervals

The Keller folder does include `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` as an example of a blank-APN edge case for 61.x devices, but no equivalent exists for 8-bit devices.

### Rayven / Datamono 8-bit variant

There is no 8-bit Rayven or Datamono variant. In the 61.x CEA folder, `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv` exists as a Rayven-specific variant of `50.131 LMU1220 units.csv`, but within the `8bit Script` folder there is no corresponding split between a CI-only and a Rayven-enabled configuration.

### Authoritative file determination

Both committed files are byte-for-byte identical. The base file (`...Thes10.csv`) is the authoritative copy. The `(1)` copy has no operational distinction and is a redundant artefact.

### Relationship to CEA 50.131 / 50.132

The `Aus Script/CEA/50.131 LMU1220 units.csv` and `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv` share the same register numbering range (parameter 257 onwards, same structure), suggesting these are also LMU1220 scripts — however they use a different server IP (`52.164.241.179`) rather than the hostname-based endpoints in the 8-bit scripts, and they do not contain a `2306` APN register entry, indicating the APN is either inherited or managed differently for that deployment. The CEA files are 319 rows each vs. 328 rows for the 8-bit scripts, confirming a different (non-8bit) configuration profile despite sharing the LMU1220 hardware.

## Findings

**A02-1** — HIGH: No carrier variant scripts exist for the 8-bit LMU1220 device type

**Description:** The entire 8-bit script folder covers only a single SIM carrier (Telstra, APN `data641003`). Every other device family in this repository (61.x Aus, UK, US scripts) provides paired carrier variants — Telstra plus Monogoto, DataMono, or Kore as appropriate. If an 8-bit LMU1220 device is provisioned with a non-Telstra SIM (e.g., a Monogoto or Kore SIM for international or roaming deployment), there is no validated configuration script available. An operator would need to manually derive a new script, introducing risk of misconfiguration (incorrect APN, wrong server port, untested PEG logic) without a peer-reviewed reference.

**Fix:** Create an 8-bit Monogoto variant script (replacing `data641003` with the Monogoto APN string) to match the carrier-pair pattern established in every other folder. Validate the variant on hardware before committing. If the 8-bit LMU1220 is exclusively used on Telstra, document this constraint explicitly in the README or a `8bit Script/README.md` file.

---

**A02-2** — MEDIUM: No demo or test variant exists for the 8-bit LMU1220 script

**Description:** No demo, test, or staging variant of the 8-bit script is present. The `Demo Script` folder holds only a 61.x format demo script. A demo/test variant — with a reduced reporting interval, disabled sleep, or safe server endpoint — is necessary for validating device behaviour in a lab or staging environment before deploying to production assets. Without it, engineers must either modify the production script (risking an accidental production deployment of untested settings) or deploy the full production configuration to test hardware.

**Fix:** Create a demo/test variant of the 8-bit script with a shortened sleep interval (e.g., 60-second reporting), a non-production server endpoint or blank server, and a clearly distinct filename prefix (`Demo` or `Test`). Place it in the existing `Demo Script` folder or in a dedicated `8bit Script/demo` sub-folder, consistent with the approach used for `61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv`.

---

**A02-3** — MEDIUM: No blank-APN or pre-provisioning script exists for the 8-bit device type

**Description:** The Keller sub-folder contains `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`, demonstrating awareness that a blank-APN edge-case script is needed to support devices before SIM provisioning. No equivalent exists for the 8-bit LMU1220. Devices shipped to a customer with the current script but without an activated Telstra SIM will attempt to connect to `data641003` and fail silently. A blank-APN or "safe defaults" script would allow devices to be pre-loaded in a neutral state and activated on-site.

**Fix:** Create a blank-APN variant of the 8-bit script (APN registers 2306 zeroed or set to a placeholder), modelled on the existing `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`. Store it alongside the production script in `8bit Script/`.

---

**A02-4** — LOW: No Rayven-specific 8-bit variant exists, despite Rayven variants being standard practice

**Description:** The CEA sub-folder contains both `50.131 LMU1220 units.csv` (CI-only) and `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv` (Rayven-enabled), establishing the pattern of having separate CI and Rayven variants for the same hardware and deployment context. The `8bit Script` folder has only one functional script and no Rayven equivalent. If Rayven integration is used with 8-bit devices, operators lack a validated Rayven-specific 8-bit configuration.

**Fix:** Determine whether Rayven is used or planned for 8-bit LMU1220 devices. If yes, create a Rayven variant script (`50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-Rayven-...csv`) and commit it alongside the existing CI script. If Rayven is not applicable to 8-bit devices, document this in the folder.

---

**A02-5** — LOW: Exact-duplicate file committed without purpose distinction

**Description:** Both assigned files — `...Thes10.csv` and `...Thes10 (1).csv` — are byte-for-byte identical (MD5: `467274dffe7985e2d375d5bb18aca6df`). Both were introduced in commit `678d0d4` with the message "New Scripts added". The `(1)` suffix is a Windows file-copy artefact. Having two identical files in version control creates operator confusion (which is authoritative?), doubles the storage and exposure of any sensitive values in the file, and is evidence that file management was done through filesystem copy-paste rather than version-controlled branching. The `8bit Script` folder contains only these two files — 50% of the folder's content is a redundant copy.

**Fix:** Remove `...Thes10 (1).csv` from the repository. The base file `...Thes10.csv` is the authoritative copy. Ensure deletion is committed and that git history is noted rather than rewritten, unless the organisation's policy permits history cleanup.
