**Port summary from hex-decoded CSV scripts:**

| Script Folder | Script Files | Port (hex) | Port (decimal) | Spreadsheet Match? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Aus Script/Boaroo | 69.005 | 05EB | 1515 | Yes — row 63 |

## Findings

---

**A27-1** — HIGH: Three active script customer groups absent from the spreadsheet

**Description:** The repository contains script folders for DPWorld (`Aus Script/DPWorld/`), Keller (`Aus Script/Keller/`), and UK Script (`UK Script/`) — each with deployable CSV configuration files — but none of these customers have any row in `URL & PORTS.xlsx`. This means there is no documented server IP, Rayven inbound URL, or port assignment for these customers in the canonical endpoint registry. Any operator referencing the spreadsheet to configure infrastructure would have no record of these connections.

- `Aus Script/DPWorld/`: 2 scripts (61.36, 61.37); uses port 20500 only; no Rayven port; no CI port
- `Aus Script/Keller/`: 2 scripts (61.101 uses port 1503; 61.111 uses port 11000)
- `UK Script/`: 2 scripts (161.31 uses port 11000; 161.32 uses port 1503)

**Fix:** Add rows for DPWorld, Keller, and UK Script to `URL & PORTS.xlsx` with the correct server IP/hostname, Rayven Inbound URL, and port assignments for each device type used. DPWorld may be CI-only and would receive only CI URL + port columns.

---

**A27-2** — HIGH: Duplicate port 16026 assigned to two different customers

**Description:** Row 59 assigns G70 port 16026 on `52.169.16.32` to **Kion Group**, and row 65 assigns the same G70 port 16026 on the same server to **Kion Asia**. Duplicate port assignments on the same host will cause connection routing conflicts: both customers' G70 devices would be sending data to the same TCP endpoint with no way to distinguish traffic by customer.

**Fix:** Assign a unique, unused port to Kion Asia (or Kion Group). The next unallocated G70 port in the observed sequence would be 16027 (16025 = Forklogic; 16026 = Kion Group; 16026 is duplicated). Verify which customer is currently routing correctly and reassign the other. Update all corresponding device configuration scripts if G70 scripts for these customers exist.

---

**A27-3** — HIGH: Port 1503 shared across three unrelated script deployments

**Description:** Port 1503 on `52.164.241.179` is the Rayven inbound port documented in the spreadsheet for **Demo** (row 21). However, the same port (hex `0x05DF`) is hard-coded in:
- `Aus Script/Keller/61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` (Keller customer)
- `UK Script/161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` (UK generic Rayven Demo)

Neither Keller nor the UK script customer has a row in the spreadsheet. All three scripts point CalAmp devices to the same Rayven endpoint. If deployed simultaneously for different customers, all device data would arrive on the same port with no customer segregation.

**Fix:** Assign dedicated Rayven ports to Keller and UK deployments; update the spreadsheet with corresponding rows; update the script files (`61.101` and `161.32`) to use the new port values (replace hex `05DF` with the new port's little-endian hex encoding in the affected parameter rows).

---

**A27-4** — MEDIUM: PAPE row 7 lists `103.4.235.15` in the CI Inbound URL column with no port in Port2 (F7 is empty)

**Description:** Row 7 (a sub-row under PAPE in row 6) records `103.4.235.15` as an alternate CI Inbound URL but the corresponding Port2 cell (F7) is empty. This creates an incomplete and potentially misleading record: it is unclear whether this is a second CI endpoint that is active (requiring a port), a legacy entry, or a data entry error. Without a port, the entry is non-actionable.

**Fix:** Determine whether `103.4.235.15` is an active CI endpoint for PAPE. If so, populate F7 with the correct port number (likely 11000 based on the pattern for other customers). If it is not active or is a legacy entry, remove the value from E7 to avoid confusion.

---

**A27-5** — MEDIUM: 8bit Script folder (customer "RHM") has no spreadsheet entry

**Description:** The `8bit Script/` folder contains two deployable CSV configuration files named with prefix `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-...`. The "RHM" prefix appears to denote a customer name. These scripts reference ports 20500 and 11000, but there is no row for RHM in `URL & PORTS.xlsx`. The scripts are excluded from the Aus/UK/US regional folder hierarchy, suggesting they may be a standalone deployment, but they still require endpoint documentation.

**Fix:** Add a row for RHM (or the actual customer name) to `URL & PORTS.xlsx` identifying the server IP/hostname and relevant port assignments. If these scripts are deprecated or internal test scripts, note that explicitly (e.g., move to an `Archive/` or `Test/` directory) and confirm they are not customer-facing.

---

**A27-6** — MEDIUM: 16 spreadsheet customers have no corresponding script folder

**Description:** The following 16 customers have rows in `URL & PORTS.xlsx` (with port assignments) but have no corresponding CSV script folder in the repository: Darr, Trilift, Material Handling INC, Clark Trace Demo, Arconic, C&B Equipments, Dgroup, LindeNZ, Frontier Fortlift, IAC, Wallace Distribution, Superior Industrial Products, Attached Solutions, Forklogic, Kion Group, Hunter and Northern Logistics, and Kion Asia. It is not clear whether these are customers whose scripts have not yet been committed, customers using a shared/generic script not tracked per-customer, or stale records for customers who have churned.

**Fix:** For each of the 16 customers, determine and document the disposition: (a) if they use a shared/generic script, note the script file path in the spreadsheet or README; (b) if they are active customers requiring dedicated scripts, create the script folders and commit the CSV files; (c) if they are no longer active, mark the rows as inactive or move them to an archive sheet. This will prevent the spreadsheet from conveying a false sense of broader coverage than the repository actually supports.

---

**A27-7** — LOW: Trailing whitespace in shared string index 19 ("G70 ")

**Description:** The shared strings table in `sharedStrings.xml` contains the value `G70 ` (with a trailing space, encoded as `<t xml:space="preserve">G70 </t>`) at index 19, used in the "Type of Device" column for Material Handling INC (row 27). All other G70 entries use index 11 (clean `G70`). This inconsistency may cause formula-matching or programmatic processing errors if the spreadsheet is consumed by automation that compares device type strings.

**Fix:** Edit the cell in row 27 column B to remove the trailing space, making it consistent with the clean `G70` value used in all other rows. In Excel this requires re-typing the cell value or using `TRIM()`.
