## Reading Evidence

### FILE: `Aus Script/Keller/61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`

**Row count:** 1229 rows (1 header + 1228 data rows)

**Purpose:** Pre-deployment demo script for Keller customer devices on the Rayven platform. Named "Demo Blank APN" — the device is configured to connect to a Rayven server but using an IP address (likely a staging/demo server) rather than the production hostname. The blank APN is not a unique feature of this script (see APN note below).

**APN (blank/real):** Blank. Parameters 1536,0–3 and 1537,0–3 are all `00`. This is identical to every other script in the repository; all AU scripts rely on carrier-side APN auto-provisioning. The "Blank APN" label in the filename appears to document the intended pre-provisioned SIM state rather than a technically unique configuration.

**Server, port:**
- param 2319,0 = `35 32 2E 31 36 34 2E 32 34 31 2E 31 37 39 00` → `52.164.241.179` (Azure IP address — the Rayven staging/fallback server)
- param 2319,1 = **absent** (no secondary entry)
- param 2318,0 = `2A 32 32 38 39 39 00` → `*22899` (carrier SMS activation number — common to all scripts)

**Key decoded values:**
| Parameter | Hex | Decoded |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| 2178,0 | `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` | `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` (SMS command template) |
| 2308,0 | `4B6F726500` | `Kore` (WiFi SSID) |
| 2309,0 | `4B6F726531323300` | `Kore123` (WiFi password) |
| 2318,0 | `2A323238393900` | `*22899` (SMS phone) |
| 2319,0 | `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` | `52.164.241.179` |
| 3331,0 | `2A2A2A2A2A00` | `*****` (password mask) |
| 768,0 | `34A4F1B3` | Device serial 883225011 |
| 769,0 | `05DF` | 1503 seconds (~25 min) reporting interval |

### FILE: `Aus Script/Keller/61.111 Optimal Script for Keller.csv`

**Row count:** 1229 rows (1 header + 1228 data rows)

**Purpose:** Production-intent script for Keller. The "Optimal" designation refers to power/data-optimised reporting intervals: the primary reporting interval is set to ~3 hours rather than the ~25 minutes used in the demo. Server points to the production Rayven hostname. This is the script intended for long-term field deployment once devices are handed over from demo to production.

**APN (blank/real):** Blank. Identical APN configuration to 61.101 and all other repo scripts (params 1536–1537 all zeroed). Carrier auto-provisions the APN.

**Server, port:**
- param 2319,0 = `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (production Rayven hostname)
- param 2319,1 = **absent** (secondary/fallback entry missing — present in all other production "Final" scripts)
- param 2318,0 = `2A323238393900` → `*22899`

**Key decoded values:**
| Parameter | Hex | Decoded |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| 2319,0 | `6E6172686D...636F6D00` | `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` |
| 768,0 | `6704EB0F` | Device serial 1728375567 |
| 769,0 | `2AF8` | 11000 seconds (~183 min / ~3 hr) reporting interval |
| 1024,23 | `6F` | 111 (vs 101 in 61.101 — minor config byte difference) |

## Coverage Analysis

### Structural identity

Both files are structurally identical: 1229 rows, same parameter set, same cellular config, same WiFi credentials (Kore/Kore123), same SMS number. They differ in exactly four respects:

1. **param 768,0** — device serial number (expected; written at provisioning time, not a script authoring concern)
2. **param 769,0** — primary reporting interval: 1503 s (demo) vs 11000 s (optimal)
3. **param 2319,0** — server: Azure IP `52.164.241.179` (demo) vs `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (optimal)
4. **param 1024,23** — single byte: `0x65` (101) vs `0x6F` (111)

### Is 61.101 a complete pre-provisioning script or just a demo?

61.101 is a complete script in terms of parameter count and structure. It is not a skeleton or partial template. However, it routes to an IP address that functions as the fallback/secondary server in production CEA and Komatsu scripts, rather than the production hostname. This means any device programmed with 61.101 and left in the field would report to a staging endpoint rather than the production Rayven instance. The "Demo" label is operationally accurate: 61.101 is suitable for bench testing and customer demonstrations but must not be deployed to live fleet devices without server correction.

### What makes 61.111 "Optimal"?

The "Optimal" designation is attributable to the reporting interval change: `0x2AF8` (11000 s, ~3 hours) vs `0x05DF` (1503 s, ~25 minutes). A 3-hour primary interval substantially reduces cellular data consumption and extends battery/power budget on POD-powered units. The secondary reporting slots (769,1–3 = `0x5014` = 20500 s) are unchanged between the two scripts.

### Carrier targeting

Neither Keller script is labeled for a specific AU carrier. There is no Telstra variant and no Monogoto/DataMono variant. All other AU customer directories with production "Final" scripts carry dual variants (e.g., CEA has 61.140 Telstra + 61.141 DataMono, Komatsu has 61.133 Telstra + 61.135 DataMono). Keller has no carrier-tagged "Final" scripts at all.

### Secondary/fallback server presence

All four established AU production "Final" scripts (CEA Telstra, CEA DataMono, Komatsu Telstra, Komatsu DataMono) carry two entries for param 2319:
- `2319,0` = `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (primary hostname)
- `2319,1` = `52.164.241.179` (fallback IP)

61.111 has only `2319,0` (correct hostname). The fallback IP entry is absent. If DNS for `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` is unavailable, devices running 61.111 will have no fallback path, while CEA/Komatsu production devices will automatically retry via the IP address.

### Demo-to-production relationship

The two scripts represent a sequential workflow:
- **61.101** = demo/staging: sent to customer for acceptance testing, routes to Azure staging IP, shorter reporting interval for visible feedback
- **61.111** = optimal/production: intended for field handover, routes to production hostname, longer interval for power/data efficiency

They are complementary stages of the same deployment lifecycle, not parallel alternatives for different carriers.

### Blank APN and pre-provisioning edge case

The "Blank APN" label is specifically called out in 61.101's filename but is not a differentiating feature: every script in the repository (demo and production alike) has the same zeroed APN parameters (1536, 1537). The AU scripts rely on carrier-side automatic APN provisioning, which means the SIM itself carries the APN context. The blank APN configuration is valid once a SIM is inserted from any supported carrier (Telstra, Monogoto). Prior to SIM insertion the script will load correctly on the device; the cellular modem will register once a provisioned SIM is inserted. This confirms 61.101 does cover the "devices arriving before SIM provisioning" edge case — but so does every other script in the repo.

## Findings

**A14-1** — HIGH: Missing Telstra and Monogoto/DataMono "Final" variants for Keller

**Description:** Every other AU customer with a production presence (CEA, Komatsu) has two distinct "Final" scripts: one for Telstra SIMs and one for Monogoto/DataMono SIMs. Keller has neither. The only two scripts present are a demo (61.101) and an "Optimal" script (61.111) which is not labeled "Final" and is missing the dual-server fallback present in production scripts. If Keller devices are deployed on either Telstra or Monogoto SIMs, there is no validated carrier-specific production script on file.

**Fix:** Create `61.112 Rayven Keller Telstra Final.csv` and `61.113 Rayven Keller DataMono Final.csv` following the CEA or Komatsu pattern, with both `2319,0` (hostname) and `2319,1` (fallback IP), and carrier-appropriate labeling.

---

**A14-2** — HIGH: 61.111 "Optimal Script" is missing the secondary fallback server entry (param 2319,1)

**Description:** All established AU production "Final" scripts carry two server entries for param 2319: index 0 = `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` and index 1 = `52.164.241.179` (Azure IP fallback). 61.111 has only index 0 (the hostname). A device programmed with 61.111 will fail to connect if DNS resolution for `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` is unavailable and has no IP fallback. The CEA and Komatsu production scripts have 1230 rows precisely because they include this extra row; 61.111 has only 1229 rows.

**Fix:** Add `2319,1,35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` (the Azure IP fallback) to 61.111, consistent with the production pattern in CEA and Komatsu scripts.

---

**A14-3** — MEDIUM: 61.101 routes to the staging IP address as its sole server

**Description:** param 2319,0 in 61.101 is `52.164.241.179` — the Azure IP address used as a *secondary fallback* in production scripts, not as a primary. If a demo device is not reprogrammed before field handover, it will continue reporting to the staging endpoint rather than the production Rayven hostname. There is no runtime mechanism to detect this misconfiguration.

**Fix:** Add a prominent README or header comment to the Keller folder (or a naming convention such as "DO NOT DEPLOY") making clear that 61.101 must not be used in production. Alternatively, the demo script should be built around the production hostname with a short reporting interval rather than a different server endpoint, reducing the risk of accidental production deployment.

---

**A14-4** — LOW: "Blank APN" label in 61.101 filename is misleading

**Description:** The filename `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` implies that blank APN is a distinguishing feature of this script. In reality, all 18 scripts in the repository (AU, UK, US) carry blank/zeroed APN parameters (1536, 1537 all `00`). The label creates an impression that other scripts have a populated APN when they do not, and may cause operators to incorrectly believe 61.101 covers a special carrier-configuration edge case not covered elsewhere.

**Fix:** Rename the file to remove "Blank APN" from the title, or add clarifying documentation noting that blank APN is the universal configuration across all CalAmp scripts in this repository and is carrier-resolved at SIM level.

---

**A14-5** — LOW: Device serial numbers (param 768,0) are embedded in version-controlled script files

**Description:** Both 61.101 and 61.111 contain hard-coded device serial numbers in param 768,0 (`34A4F1B3` and `6704EB0F` respectively). These are unique hardware identifiers for the specific test/demo devices used when the scripts were generated. If these scripts are applied to different physical devices, param 768,0 will overwrite the device's own serial register with an incorrect value sourced from a different unit. This pattern appears throughout the repository but is most visible in the Keller pair because both scripts differ in this value, confirming each was captured from a different physical device.

**Fix:** Strip param 768,0 from all template/master scripts before committing to version control, or document explicitly that these scripts are single-device captures and must be regenerated per target device prior to fleet deployment.
