## Reading Evidence

### FILE: `US Script/Matthai/61.137 Rayven and CI clone Matthai DataMono.csv`

**Row count:** 1229 data rows (1230 lines including header)

**Platform:** Rayven + CI clone (dual-server)

**APN decoded:**
- `2306,0`: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → `data.mono`
- `2306,1`: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → `data.mono`
- Both APN slots set to DataMono/Monogoto APN `data.mono`

**Primary server decoded:**
- `2319,0`: `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`
- `768,0` = `6704EB0F` → IP `103.4.235.15`
- `769,0` = `2AF8` → port `11000` (Rayven platform port)

**Secondary server:**
- `2319,1`: `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → `52.164.241.179`
- `768,1` = `34A4F1B3` → IP `52.164.241.179` (confirmed match)
- `769,1` = `05DE` → port `1502` (CI platform port)

**SMS dial string:**
- `2318,0`: `2A323238393900` → `*22899`

**2178,0 (EA/access control):** `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` → `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`

**3331,0 (SMS password):** `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****`

**Key differences from other Matthai files:**
- Only file with a dual-server configuration: Rayven hostname (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) on port 11000 as primary, CI IP (`52.164.241.179`) on port 1502 as secondary/fallback
- `768,0` carries a distinct IP (`103.4.235.15`) not present in 61.138 or 61.139
- `1024,23` = `0x89` (137 decimal) — unique value; 61.138 has `0x8A`, 61.139 has `0x8B`
- `1024,1` = `0x3E` (62) — same as 61.138, differs from 61.139 (`0x3D`)
- Has `2306` APN parameters; does not have `2308`/`2309` carrier credentials

### FILE: `US Script/Matthai/61.138 Rayven Matthai DataMono.csv`

**Row count:** 1229 data rows (1230 lines including header)

**Platform:** Named "Rayven" but single-server configuration pointing to CI IP/port

**APN decoded:**
- `2306,0`: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → `data.mono`
- `2306,1`: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → `data.mono`

**Primary server decoded:**
- `2319,0`: `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → `52.164.241.179`
- `768,0` = `34A4F1B3` → IP `52.164.241.179` (confirmed match)
- `769,0` = `05DE` → port `1502`

**Secondary server:** None (no `2319,1`, `768,1` = `00000000`)

**SMS dial string:**
- `2318,0`: `2A323238393900` → `*22899`

**2178,0 (EA/access control):** `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` → `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`

**3331,0 (SMS password):** `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****`

**Key differences from other Matthai files:**
- Single-server configuration; uses only `52.164.241.179:1502` — the same IP and port as the CI fallback in 61.137
- No Rayven hostname present in `2319`; no `103.4.235.15` anywhere in this file
- The filename says "Rayven" but the server endpoint is the CI IP on the CI port; this naming is ambiguous or inconsistent — `52.164.241.179:1502` may be a shared endpoint or this script actually targets CI infrastructure
- `1024,23` = `0x8A` (138) — unique sequence value
- Has `2306` APN; does not have carrier credentials (`2308`/`2309`)

### FILE: `US Script/Matthai/61.139 Rayven Mathhai Kore.csv`

**Row count:** 1229 data rows (1230 lines including header)

**Platform:** Rayven (single-server, Kore carrier)

**APN decoded:**
- No `2306` parameter present — Kore SIM supplies APN automatically via carrier SIM provisioning
- `2307,0` = `00` (APN username — empty)
- `2308,0`: `4B6F726500` → `Kore` (carrier credential username)
- `2309,0`: `4B6F726531323300` → `Kore123` (carrier credential password — cleartext hardcoded default)

**Primary server decoded:**
- `2319,0`: `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → `52.164.241.179`
- `768,0` = `34A4F1B3` → IP `52.164.241.179`
- `769,0` = `05DE` → port `1502`

**Secondary server:** None

**SMS dial string:**
- `2318,0`: `2A323238393900` → `*22899`

**2178,0 (EA/access control):** `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` → `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`

**3331,0 (SMS password):** `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****`

**Key differences from other Matthai files:**
- Only file using Kore carrier: no `2306` APN, has `2308`/`2309` Kore credentials
- `2309,0` = `Kore123` — this appears to be a factory-default or placeholder password, stored cleartext in the script
- `1024,1` = `0x3D` (61) vs `0x3E` (62) in both DataMono files — minor but distinct hardware config difference
- `1024,23` = `0x8B` (139) — unique sequence value continuing the pattern 137/138/139 across the three files
- Filename contains typo "Mathhai" (double `h`) vs "Matthai" used in 61.137 and 61.138

## Coverage Analysis

### What the three scripts cover

| Script | Carrier | Platform | Server config |
|--------|---------|----------|---------------|
| 61.137 | DataMono/Monogoto | Rayven primary + CI fallback | Dual: 103.4.235.15:11000 (Rayven) + 52.164.241.179:1502 (CI) |
| 61.138 | DataMono/Monogoto | Named Rayven, single-server CI IP | Single: 52.164.241.179:1502 |
| 61.139 | Kore | Rayven (single-server) | Single: 52.164.241.179:1502 |

The set covers two US carriers (DataMono/Monogoto and Kore) for the Matthai customer. All three files share the same event/motion/I/O parameter blocks (params 256–913, 512–515, 768–779) with only minor differences in `1024,1` and `1024,23` bytes.

### Why are there two DataMono variants (61.137 and 61.138)?

The functional difference is the server configuration:

- **61.137** is a dual-server script intended for a transition or migration scenario. The Rayven platform hostname (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`, IP `103.4.235.15`, port `11000`) is primary; the CI IP (`52.164.241.179`, port `1502`) is the fallback. This is the "and CI clone" mentioned in the filename — a device running 61.137 will report to Rayven and fall back to CI if Rayven is unavailable.

- **61.138** is a single-server script using only `52.164.241.179:1502`. Despite the filename saying "Rayven", this endpoint is the same IP and port as the CI fallback in 61.137. This may mean 61.138 is actually a CI-only DataMono script mislabelled as Rayven, or that `52.164.241.179:1502` is a shared endpoint that both CI and Rayven accept. Either interpretation represents a naming/documentation ambiguity.

### Is a CI-only Matthai script missing?

Based on the naming pattern, a dedicated CI-only Matthai DataMono script (equivalent to 61.137 but with no Rayven server, only CI) does not exist. If 61.138 is genuinely CI-only (as its single server endpoint suggests), it is mislabelled as "Rayven". The set lacks an unambiguously named CI-only DataMono script.

A CI-only Kore script for Matthai is also absent.

### Is a Kore + CI-clone combined script missing?

Yes. There is no equivalent of 61.137 (dual-server) for Kore. The Kore script (61.139) is single-server only. A Kore variant with Rayven primary and CI fallback does not exist in this set.

### Is there a demo or pre-provisioning Matthai script?

No. The Matthai folder contains only three production scripts. There is no demo script, no pre-provisioning script, and no staging variant. This contrasts with other US customers (e.g., Keller) which have dedicated demo scripts.

### Is the filename typo "Mathhai" in 61.139 a concern?

Yes. The filename `61.139 Rayven Mathhai Kore.csv` uses "Mathhai" (double `h`) while the other two files use "Matthai". This typo is a risk in automated deployment pipelines or filename-based script selection logic. A script search for "Matthai" would not return 61.139; a search for "Mathhai" would return only 61.139. If scripts are selected by customer name string matching, 61.139 could be excluded or misapplied. The internal content is correct (same customer configuration), but the filename divergence undermines reliable file discovery.

### Comparison with AU customer coverage depth

AU customer scripts (observed in other agents' assignments) follow a pattern that includes separate scripts per carrier and per platform (CI vs Rayven), often with a combined/dual-server script as well as a pre-provisioning or staging variant. The Matthai set mirrors this partially (two DataMono variants, one Kore variant) but lacks:
- A pre-provisioning or demo script
- A clearly named CI-only DataMono script (the naming of 61.138 is ambiguous)
- A dual-server Kore variant
- Any staging or test environment variant

AU sets also tend to avoid hardcoded carrier credentials in plaintext. The `Kore123` password in 61.139 would not meet that standard.

## Findings

**A28-1** — MEDIUM: Ambiguous platform labelling in 61.138 — "Rayven" name but CI server endpoint

**Description:** The file `61.138 Rayven Matthai DataMono.csv` is named "Rayven" but its sole server entry (`2319,0`) resolves to `52.164.241.179` on port `1502`. This IP and port are identical to the CI fallback configured in `61.137`. No Rayven-specific hostname (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) and no Rayven port (`11000`) appear anywhere in 61.138. Either this script actually targets CI infrastructure and is mislabelled, or `52.164.241.179:1502` is a shared endpoint for both platforms without documentation to that effect. If it is CI-only, devices provisioned with 61.138 will not report to Rayven despite the filename implying they will.

**Fix:** Confirm the intended platform for 61.138. If it is CI-only, rename the file to `61.138 CI Matthai DataMono.csv` and create a distinct Rayven-only file using the Rayven hostname and port `11000`. If `52.164.241.179:1502` genuinely serves both platforms, document this in the repository and add a comment to the filename (e.g., "Rayven-CI shared endpoint").

---

**A28-2** — LOW: Filename typo in 61.139 — "Mathhai" instead of "Matthai"

**Description:** The filename `61.139 Rayven Mathhai Kore.csv` contains the misspelling "Mathhai" (extra `h`). All other Matthai scripts, and the folder name itself, use "Matthai". This discrepancy will cause the file to be missed by any filename-pattern search, grep, or automated deployment logic that filters for the string "Matthai". The internal script content is correctly configured for the Matthai customer.

**Fix:** Rename the file to `61.139 Rayven Matthai Kore.csv` to match the correct customer name spelling used in all other files and the folder name.

---

**A28-3** — MEDIUM: Hardcoded cleartext default carrier password in 61.139

**Description:** Parameter `2309,0` in `61.139 Rayven Mathhai Kore.csv` decodes to `Kore123`. This is a factory-default or placeholder password for the Kore carrier credential stored verbatim in the provisioning script. If this is the live production password, it represents a weak, guessable credential stored in plaintext in a version-controlled file. If it is a placeholder that was never updated, devices provisioned with this script may fail to authenticate with Kore.

**Fix:** Replace `Kore123` with the actual Kore carrier password for this account. If the password must appear in the script, ensure it is the correct production credential. Review whether the git history exposes the credential and, if so, assess whether rotation is required. Consider aligning with any credential-management policy used for other carrier scripts in the repository.

---

**A28-4** — LOW: Missing CI-only Matthai scripts (DataMono and Kore)

**Description:** The Matthai folder has no unambiguously named CI-only script for either DataMono or Kore. The set covers: one dual-platform script (61.137, Rayven+CI, DataMono), one ambiguously labelled single-server script (61.138, DataMono), and one Rayven-only Kore script (61.139). A CI-only DataMono script is absent or hidden under the "Rayven" label of 61.138. A CI-only Kore script does not exist at all. If Matthai devices need to be provisioned to CI infrastructure only (e.g., for a subset of hardware or a phased migration), no dedicated, unambiguously labelled script exists for that use case.

**Fix:** Create or correctly label a `CI Matthai DataMono.csv` script and a `CI Matthai Kore.csv` script. The DataMono version may already exist as 61.138 pending the rename from A28-1.

---

**A28-5** — LOW: No dual-server (Rayven+CI clone) variant for Kore carrier

**Description:** Script 61.137 provides a dual-server configuration for DataMono (Rayven primary + CI fallback), supporting devices that need to transition between platforms or maintain fallback connectivity. No equivalent dual-server script exists for the Kore carrier. Script 61.139 is Kore single-server only. If Matthai operates Kore-SIM devices alongside DataMono-SIM devices and requires the same Rayven+CI resilience for both carrier populations, the Kore fleet is under-served.

**Fix:** Assess whether Matthai Kore-SIM devices require a dual-server (Rayven+CI) configuration. If so, create `61.140 Rayven and CI clone Matthai Kore.csv` modelled on 61.137 but substituting the Kore carrier parameters (`2308`/`2309`) in place of the `2306` APN entries.

---

**A28-6** — LOW: No demo or pre-provisioning script for Matthai

**Description:** The Matthai folder contains only three production provisioning scripts. There is no demo script (reduced reporting intervals for sales demonstrations), no pre-provisioning script (minimal configuration applied before full customer onboarding), and no staging variant. Other US customers in the repository (e.g., Keller) have dedicated demo scripts. The absence means any Matthai demonstration or pre-deployment staging must either use a production script (risking misconfiguration) or borrow a script from another customer.

**Fix:** Create a Matthai demo script with appropriate demonstration settings (e.g., higher reporting frequency, test server endpoint) and, if Matthai devices require pre-provisioning before SIM activation, a corresponding pre-provisioning variant. Follow the naming convention used for other customers with demo scripts.
