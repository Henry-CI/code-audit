## Reading Evidence

### FILE: `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/Aus Script/DPWorld/61.36 CI DPWORLD Telstra Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1251 lines (1250 data rows + 1 header)

**Purpose:** CI (CalAmp Intelligence / legacy dashboard) configuration for DPWorld AU fleet on the Telstra network.

**APN, server, port:**
- param 2306 index 0 and 1 (APN): `telstra.internet`
- param 2308 (APN username): `Kore`
- param 2309 (APN password): `Kore123`
- param 2311 (port, hex `5014`): `20500`
- param 2319 (primary server): `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`
- param 2320 (secondary server): `maint.vehicle-location.com`
- param 2322 (reporting interval, hex `00015180`): `86400` seconds (24 hours)

**Additional decoded values:**
- param 2314 / 2315 (username/password fields): `dummy` (placeholder — indicates pre-provisioning state or unused field)
- param 2316 (dial string): `*99***1#`
- param 2318: `*22899`
- param 2178 (message format token): `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`

**Platform:** CI only — servers `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` and `maint.vehicle-location.com` are the CalAmp/tracking-intelligence CI platform, not Rayven.

### FILE: `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/Aus Script/DPWorld/61.37 CI DPWORLD Data.mono Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1251 lines (1250 data rows + 1 header)

**Purpose:** CI configuration for DPWorld AU fleet on the Monogoto (Data.mono) network.

**APN, server, port:**
- param 2306 index 0 and 1 (APN): `data.mono`
- param 2308 (APN username): `Kore`
- param 2309 (APN password): `Kore123`
- param 2311 (port, hex `5014`): `20500`
- param 2319 (primary server): `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`
- param 2320 (secondary server): `maint.vehicle-location.com`
- param 2322 (reporting interval, hex `00015180`): `86400` seconds (24 hours)
- param 2314 / 2315: `dummy` (placeholder)

**Platform:** CI only — identical server/port pair as 61.36; only the APN differs.

### Key Differences Between the Two Files

| Parameter | 61.36 Telstra | 61.37 Data.mono |
|---|---|---|
| param 2306 (APN) | `telstra.internet` | `data.mono` |
| param 1024,23 | `0x24` (36 decimal) | `0x25` (37 decimal) |
| All other params | Identical | Identical |

The sole functional difference is the APN string. param 1024,23 differs by one (36 vs 37 decimal), which is consistent with a carrier-index or SIM-slot selector field that distinguishes the two carrier configurations. All event rules (param 512), thresholds, timers, I/O mappings, server addresses, and port settings are byte-for-byte identical.

## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Rayven or "Rayven and CI clone" variant — MISSING

DPWorld has only CI scripts (prefix 61.x). No Rayven-only or "Rayven and CI clone" variant exists for either carrier. Comparing against the other AU customers:

| Customer | CI Telstra | CI DataMono | Rayven+CI Telstra | Rayven+CI DataMono | RD Telstra | RD Monogoto | Demo/Blank |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DPWorld | 61.36 | 61.37 | **MISSING** | **MISSING** | **MISSING** | **MISSING** | **MISSING** |
| CEA | — | — | 61.140 | 61.141 | 69.003 | 69.004 | — |
| Komatsu | — | — | 61.133 | 61.135 | 69.001 | 69.002 | — |
| Keller | — | — | — | — | — | — | 61.101 |

CEA has 6 scripts and Komatsu has 4. DPWorld has only 2 and uses a fundamentally different platform pattern (CI-only rather than Rayven-integrated).

### 2. Demo or blank-APN script — MISSING

No DPWorld demo or blank-APN pre-provisioning script exists (contrast with Keller's `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`). The `dummy` values in params 2314 and 2315 within both DPWorld scripts are APN credential placeholders within the live scripts, not a dedicated demo script.

### 3. Carrier pair completeness

The two scripts form a complete carrier pair for the CI platform:
- 61.36 covers Telstra (APN `telstra.internet`)
- 61.37 covers Monogoto/DataMono (APN `data.mono`)

As a CI-only pair the carrier coverage is internally consistent.

### 4. Comparison to CEA and Komatsu coverage

- **CEA (6 scripts):** Has Rayven+CI-clone pair for both carriers, plus RD-prefix (69.x) pair for both carriers. No dedicated CI-only scripts.
- **Komatsu (4 scripts):** Has Rayven+CI-clone pair for both carriers, plus RD-prefix (69.x) pair for both carriers. No dedicated CI-only scripts.
- **DPWorld (2 scripts):** Has CI-only pair for both carriers. No Rayven variant, no RD-prefix variant, no demo script.

DPWorld's coverage is the thinnest of any AU customer with a carrier pair: it covers 2 of the 7 script types represented across the AU folder.

### 5. RD-prefix (69.x) variant — MISSING

No `69.x` RD-prefix script exists for DPWorld. CEA and Komatsu each have two 69.x scripts (one Telstra, one Monogoto). DPWorld has none.

## Findings

**A12-1** — MEDIUM: No Rayven or "Rayven and CI clone" variant exists for DPWorld

**Description:** DPWorld is provisioned with CI-only scripts (61.36 and 61.37). Every other AU customer using a carrier pair (CEA, Komatsu) uses a "Rayven and CI clone" integration pattern (61.140/141, 61.133/135). If DPWorld devices are expected to report to a Rayven platform — or if the fleet is migrating — no ready-to-deploy Rayven or dual-platform script exists for either Telstra or Monogoto.

**Fix:** Determine whether DPWorld requires Rayven integration. If yes, create `61.x Rayven and CI clone DPWORLD Telstra Final.csv` and `61.x Rayven and CI clone DPWORLD Data.mono Final.csv` modelled on the CEA or Komatsu equivalents, substituting DPWorld-specific server/APN values.

---

**A12-2** — LOW: No RD-prefix (69.x) remote-download variant exists for DPWorld

**Description:** CEA and Komatsu both maintain 69.x scripts for remote/OTA device configuration. DPWorld has no equivalent. If DPWorld devices require remote reconfiguration without a physical connection, there is no tested RD script on hand.

**Fix:** If OTA reconfiguration is operationally required for DPWorld, create `69.x RD DPWORLD Telstra Final.csv` and `69.x RD DPWORLD Monogoto Final.csv`, following the CEA 69.003/69.004 pattern.

---

**A12-3** — LOW: No demo or blank-APN pre-provisioning script for DPWorld

**Description:** Keller has a dedicated demo/blank-APN script (`61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`) for staging devices before SIM provisioning. DPWorld has no equivalent. The `dummy` placeholder values in params 2314/2315 in the live scripts are not a substitute for a dedicated pre-provisioning script.

**Fix:** If DPWorld devices are staged or demo-tested prior to SIM provisioning, create a `61.x CI DPWORLD Demo Blank APN.csv` with APN fields zeroed or set to a known-safe placeholder, distinct from the production scripts.

---

**A12-4** — INFO: param 1024,23 differs by 1 between 61.36 and 61.37 (0x24 vs 0x25)

**Description:** Both files are otherwise byte-for-byte identical except for the APN (param 2306) and param 1024 index 23 (0x24 = 36 decimal in 61.36 vs 0x25 = 37 decimal in 61.37). This one-byte field difference is consistent with a carrier-index selector and appears intentional. However, the field is not documented within the repository, so its exact semantics cannot be independently verified from these files alone.

**Fix:** Add an inline comment or companion README within the DPWorld folder documenting the intended meaning of param 1024,23 to prevent future confusion during maintenance.
