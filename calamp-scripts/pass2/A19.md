## Coverage Analysis

### 69.002 — Pairing with 69.001 as Complete RD Komatsu Carrier Set

**Structural diff: 69.001 (Telstra) vs 69.002 (Monogoto) — exactly 3 differences:**

| Parameter | 69.001 Telstra | 69.002 Monogoto | Meaning |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| `1024,23` | `0x01` | `0x02` | Internal flag; carrier-specific config |
| `2306,0` | ABSENT | `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` = `data.mono` | APN slot 0 |
| `2306,1` | ABSENT | `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` = `data.mono` | APN slot 1 |

This is the expected minimal diff for a carrier-swap pair:
- 69.001 (Telstra) leaves APN blank, relying on the SIM's default Telstra APN.
- 69.002 (Monogoto) explicitly sets `data.mono` for both APN slots.
- `1024,23` carries a single-bit carrier flag, which is the established pattern for this script family (same pattern seen between 61.133 and 61.135).
- All behavioural parameters (intervals, event rules, I/O configs, SMS auth) are identical.

**The pairing is correct and consistent.** 69.002 is a proper Monogoto complement to 69.001 Telstra.

### Komatsu Complete Set Assessment: 61.133, 61.135, 69.001, 69.002

The Komatsu AU folder now contains four scripts:

| Script | Platform | Carrier | Server | Port (primary) |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| 61.133 | Rayven + CI clone | Telstra | narhm.tracking-intelligence.com | 11000 |
| 61.135 | Rayven + CI clone | Monogoto/data.mono | narhm.tracking-intelligence.com | 11000 |
| 69.001 | RD (Rayven-direct?) | Telstra | 52.164.241.179 | 1500 |
| 69.002 | RD (Rayven-direct?) | Monogoto/data.mono | 52.164.241.179 | 1500 |

The set has both carrier variants for both platform variants. The `61.x` and `69.x` series target different servers entirely (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com:11000` vs `52.164.241.179:1500`), indicating two distinct backend environments or service tiers for Komatsu AU. Each tier now has Telstra and Monogoto coverage. **The set is structurally complete** as a four-file carrier-by-platform matrix.

A minor note: 69.001 has 1228 rows versus 69.002's 1230 rows. The difference is precisely the two added `2306` APN rows — consistent with the diff above.

### 61.142 (Demo Script) — Coverage Analysis

#### Does the Demo Script point to a dedicated demo/staging server?

The demo uses the **same server IP (`52.164.241.179`) as the production `69.x` RD scripts**. It is not an isolated staging or demo-only server. The only observable differentiation from production is:

- **Port 1503** instead of production port **1500** (3 apart)

All three demo scripts in the repo (AU 61.142, UK 161.32, Keller 61.101) use port 1503, establishing this as a consistent convention. However:
- Port 1503 on the same physical host as production (52.164.241.179) may be a separate listener or may simply be an undocumented convention with no backend isolation guarantee.
- There is no dedicated demo hostname or IP. The UK demo (161.32) adds the hostname `dm.calamp.co.uk` alongside the same IP — this is a marginal improvement but still the same IP.
- The AU demo (61.142) does **not** include a hostname field at all, making it less identifiable than the UK variant.

The demo is **not provably isolated from production infrastructure** at the server level. If port 1503 maps to a separate backend process this would be adequate, but this cannot be confirmed from the scripts alone.

#### What carrier/APN does the demo use?

APN is `data.mono` (Monogoto). This is appropriate: demo SIMs from Monogoto/data.mono are a common choice for demonstrations because they work across multiple networks without carrier-specific provisioning. The choice is sensible for a generic demo scenario.

#### Is there only ONE demo script for the entire Australian repo?

Yes. The `Demo Script/` folder contains exactly one file: `61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv`. All other demo-related scripts found in the repo are:
- `UK Script/161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` — UK-specific demo
- `Aus Script/Keller/61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` — customer-specific Keller demo with blank APN

There is no demo script for Telstra carrier. If a demonstration must be performed using a Telstra SIM, the operator currently has no ready-made script for that scenario.

#### Does the demo cover a new device before customer provisioning?

The script does not appear to represent a "clean slate" or factory-default device state. It configures a full operational profile including:
- Specific APN (`data.mono`) — assumes a data.mono SIM is already fitted
- A target server IP and port — assumes a known demo backend
- Full event rule table (512.x), I/O configurations, and reporting intervals

This is a standard deployment script applied to a device being used for demo purposes, not a script designed for pre-provisioning validation or "no SIM / any SIM" testing.

#### Are reporting intervals shortened for demo purposes?

No. The demo script uses identical reporting intervals to the production scripts:
- In-trip interval: 10 seconds (`265,0 = 0x0A`)
- Idle interval: 180 seconds / 3 minutes (`265,1 = 0xB4`)
- Stationary timeout: 6 hours (`265,4 = 0x5460`)

For demonstration purposes — where showing responsiveness quickly is important — a shortened idle interval (e.g., 30 seconds) and reduced stationary timeout would be more effective. The current configuration will behave identically to a live deployment, which may frustrate demos where the device must be shown tracking in a stationary environment.

#### Comparison to US Demo approach (PAPE customer gap)

The US PAPE customer has no dedicated demo script in the repo. The AU `Demo Script/` folder at least has one generic demo script (61.142). However:
- The AU demo is carrier-specific (data.mono only) — not a universal AU demo
- The AU demo does not have a Telstra variant
- The US PAPE gap means that any US demonstration would require adapting a production script on-the-fly, which carries risk of misconfiguration

## Findings

**A19-1** — LOW: 69.002 missing explicit hostname — minor documentation gap

**Description:** `69.002` sets the server as a raw IP address (`52.164.241.179`) via param 2319 with no accompanying hostname (param 2320 absent). The companion `69.001` is identical in this regard. If the server IP changes, both scripts require manual updates. The UK Demo (161.32) demonstrates the pattern of including both IP and hostname. The `61.133`/`61.135` pair uses a hostname-only approach (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) which is more resilient.

**Fix:** Add a `2320,0` hostname entry to both `69.001` and `69.002` alongside the existing IP in `2319,0`, to mirror the approach used by other scripts and improve maintainability.

---

**A19-2** — MEDIUM: Demo script (61.142) points to the same server IP as production with no confirmed backend isolation

**Description:** `61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` targets `52.164.241.179` port 1503. The production `69.x` RD scripts target the same IP on port 1500. Port 1503 is consistently used across all three repo demo scripts (AU, UK, Keller) and is likely a convention for a demo listener. However, no hostname differentiates the demo endpoint from the production IP, and there is no documentation confirming port 1503 is a fully isolated backend. If port 1503 on that host routes to the same data pipeline as 1500, demo device tracks would appear in production data streams.

**Fix:** (a) Confirm that port 1503 on `52.164.241.179` routes to an isolated demo tenant or separate data store. (b) Add a `2320,0` hostname parameter to 61.142 that names the demo endpoint distinctly (as done in 161.32 with `dm.calamp.co.uk`). (c) If a dedicated demo server or IP exists, migrate all AU demo scripts to it.

---

**A19-3** — LOW: Demo script uses production-equivalent reporting intervals

**Description:** `61.142` configures the same 10-second in-trip and 3-minute idle reporting intervals as production scripts. For demonstration scenarios — especially stationary demos — a 3-minute idle interval means the device will send no positional updates for 3 minutes after stopping. The 6-hour stationary timeout means a device placed on a desk will appear silent until 6 hours elapse. This makes live demonstrations harder to execute convincingly.

**Fix:** Consider a dedicated demo profile with shortened intervals (e.g., 30-second idle interval, 5-minute stationary timeout) so that the device remains visibly active during demonstrations. Alternatively, document that demo operators must manually adjust these parameters before each demo.

---

**A19-4** — LOW: AU Demo folder has single carrier variant only (data.mono; no Telstra demo)

**Description:** The `Demo Script/` folder contains only one file, which requires a Monogoto/data.mono SIM. There is no AU demo script for Telstra. If a prospect or customer demo requires a Telstra SIM, no pre-validated script is available. The UK folder has a similar single-carrier demo. The Keller AU folder provides a separate demo with blank APN as a workaround, but it is customer-scoped.

**Fix:** Add a Telstra variant of the AU demo script (`61.143 Demo Rayven Telstra.csv`) with the blank-APN approach (matching 69.001's pattern) so that demos using Telstra SIMs are equally supported.

---

**A19-5** — INFORMATIONAL: Demo script does not represent a pre-provisioning / new device scenario

**Description:** `61.142` is a standard operational deployment script applied to a demo device. It assumes a data.mono SIM is already fitted and a target server is known. There is no "blank APN, any server" pre-provisioning script in the `Demo Script/` folder itself. The Keller folder's `61.101` with blank APN partially addresses this need for Keller-context demos. The US PAPE customer similarly has no demo script of any kind, meaning US demo operators have no standardised baseline.

**Fix:** Consider creating a generic pre-provisioning baseline script in `Demo Script/` with blank APN and documented server placeholder that can be used before carrier assignment is finalised, similar to `61.101`'s blank-APN approach but scoped to the generic demo folder.

---

**A19-6** — INFORMATIONAL: Komatsu AU set is now complete as a four-file carrier-by-platform matrix

**Description:** With 69.002 added, the Komatsu AU folder contains all four expected combinations: Rayven+CI-clone on Telstra (61.133), Rayven+CI-clone on data.mono (61.135), RD on Telstra (69.001), and RD on data.mono/Monogoto (69.002). The three-difference pattern between 69.001 and 69.002 (APN rows added, single carrier-flag byte changed) is consistent with the pattern between 61.133 and 61.135, confirming correct derivation methodology.

**Fix:** No action required. This is a coverage confirmation.
