### FILE: `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/Aus Script/61.61 General for CI old dashboard datamono.csv`

**Row count:** 1232 data rows (1 header + 1231 parameter rows)

**Purpose (customer/use-case):** General-purpose Australian script targeting the CI (CalAmp Intelligence) "old dashboard" platform via the DataMono/Monogoto APN. The "General" designation indicates this script is not customer-specific — it appears to have served as a shared baseline for CI-platform customers using the Monogoto SIM carrier. The filename explicitly marks it as targeting the legacy/old dashboard, implying a newer dashboard variant should supersede it.

**APN configured:**
- Parameter 2306,0 = `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → decoded: `data.mono`
- Parameter 2306,1 = `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → decoded: `data.mono`
- Both slots set to `data.mono` (DataMono/Monogoto APN)

**Server endpoints:**
- Parameter 768,0 = `6704EB0F` → decoded (little-endian): `15.235.4.103`
- Parameter 769,0 = `2AF8` → decoded: port `11000`
- Parameter 2318,0 = `2A323238393900` → decoded: `*22899` (SMS/USSD provisioning number)
- Parameter 2319,0 = `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` → decoded: `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`
- Parameter 2312,0 = `0011` → decimal 17 (UDP/TCP port selector)
- Parameter 2308,0 = `4B6F726500` → decoded: `Kore` (carrier credential label)
- Parameter 2309,0 = `4B6F726531323300` → decoded: `Kore123` (SIM credential username)
- Parameter 3331,0 = `2A2A2A2A2A00` → decoded: `*****` (masked PIN/password)

**Key behavioural parameters:**
- Parameter 1024,1 = `3D` (decimal 61) — consistent with script numbering series 61.x
- Parameter 1024,23 = `3D` (decimal 61) — same, confirming script identity byte matches 61.x
- Parameter 265,0 = `0000000A` (10 s — GPS fix interval in motion)
- Parameter 265,1 = `000000B4` (180 s — GPS fix interval parked)
- Parameter 265,4 = `00005460` (21600 s = 6 h — max heartbeat interval)
- Parameters 770,0–7 all `0000` — no geofence zones active
- Parameter 1538,0 = `0002`, 1538,3 = `0001` — comm mode settings (primary/fallback)
- Parameters 2178,0 decoded: `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` — standard CalAmp message header template

### FILE: `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/Aus Script/Boaroo/69.005 Rayven Boaroo Telstra Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1230 data rows (1 header + 1229 parameter rows)

**Purpose (customer/use-case):** Production script for the Boaroo customer, using the Rayven IoT platform, deployed on the Telstra carrier. The "Final" suffix indicates this is the active production configuration, not a draft or demo. Script number 69.005 places it in the 69.x series alongside other Rayven-platform finalised scripts (compare: 69.001 Komatsu Telstra, 69.002 Komatsu Monogoto, 69.003 CEA Telstra, 69.004 CEA Monogoto).

**APN configured:**
- Parameter 2306 is entirely absent from this file — no APN row present.
- This is correct for Telstra SIM cards: the Telstra APN (`telstra.internet`) is provisioned automatically by the SIM; explicitly setting an APN is not required. This matches the pattern seen in CEA Telstra (69.003) and Komatsu Telstra (69.001).

**Server endpoints:**
- Parameter 768,0 = `34A4F1B3` → decoded (little-endian): `179.241.164.52`
- Parameter 769,0 = `05EB` → decoded: port `1515`
- Parameter 2318,0 = `2A323238393900` → decoded: `*22899` (provisioning number, same as 61.61)
- Parameter 2319,0 = `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → decoded: `52.164.241.179` (IP-form server address — note this is the reverse of 179.241.164.52, suggesting a second server address or possibly an Azure-hosted endpoint)
- Parameter 2308,0 = `4B6F726500` → decoded: `Kore` (carrier credential label)
- Parameter 2309,0 = `4B6F726531323300` → decoded: `Kore123` (SIM credential username)
- Parameter 3331,0 = `2A2A2A2A2A00` → decoded: `*****` (masked PIN/password)
- Parameter 2312,0 = `0011` → decimal 17

**Key behavioural parameters:**
- Parameter 1024,1 = `45` (decimal 69) — confirms script identity byte aligns with 69.x series
- Parameter 1024,23 = `05` (decimal 5) — script sub-index (fifth script in series, matching .005)
- Parameter 265,0 = `0000000A` (10 s in motion), 265,1 = `000000B4` (180 s parked) — same intervals as 61.61
- Parameter 265,4 = `00005460` (21600 s = 6 h heartbeat) — same as 61.61
- Parameters 770,0–7 all `0000` — no geofences active
- Parameter 1538,0 = `0002`, 1538,3 = `0001` — same comm mode pattern as 61.61
- Parameter 2178,0 decoded: `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` — standard CalAmp header template (identical to 61.61)

**Structural differences from 61.61:**
- Server IP/port differ: 61.61 targets `15.235.4.103:11000` (hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`); 69.005 targets `179.241.164.52:1515` (Rayven platform endpoint)
- 69.005 omits parameter 2306 (APN) as Telstra SIM handles this implicitly
- 69.005 omits parameter 1024,1 value `3D` (61.61's script-ID byte) — uses `45` (69 decimal) instead
- Both files are otherwise structurally near-identical in their parameter IDs and event table layout (parameter 512 entries match across both files)

## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Is there a current/new-dashboard equivalent to 61.61?

The filename explicitly labels 61.61 as targeting the "old dashboard". A search of the full `Aus Script` directory shows **no corresponding "new dashboard" or "current dashboard" variant** of a General DataMono script. The only other DataMono-suffix scripts in the repo are customer-specific (CEA 61.141, Komatsu 61.135). There is no general-purpose CI new-dashboard DataMono script. This is a gap.

Furthermore, the 61.x series for CEA and Komatsu has been superseded by 69.x Rayven finals (69.001–69.005). The 61.61 General script sits outside any customer folder, suggesting it may have been used as a bootstrap or staging template. No Telstra-APN counterpart to 61.61 exists at all (no `61.62` or equivalent "General for CI old dashboard Telstra").

### 2. What makes 61.61 "General" rather than customer-specific?

Comparing 61.61 with customer-specific scripts (e.g., CEA 61.140/141, Komatsu 61.133/135), the 61.61 file:
- Uses a generic USSD server provisioning address (`*22899`) shared with all scripts
- Uses the `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` hostname (the CI old-dashboard endpoint) rather than a Rayven IP
- Has no customer-specific geofence configuration (all zone parameters zeroed)
- Contains the `data.mono` APN explicitly in both primary and secondary SIM slots
- Is placed at the `Aus Script/` root rather than in a named customer subfolder

The "General" label is correct — this script appears to be a non-customer-specific template or baseline used for devices provisioned to the CI platform on Monogoto SIMs before a customer-specific script was applied.

### 3. Is a Monogoto/DataMono variant missing for Boaroo?

**Yes.** The Boaroo folder contains exactly one file: `69.005 Rayven Boaroo Telstra Final.csv`. All comparable Australian customers have a paired Monogoto variant:

| Customer | Telstra script | Monogoto script |
|---|---|---|
| Komatsu | 69.001 RD Komatsu Telstra Final | 69.002 RD Komatsu Monogoto Final |
| CEA | 69.003 RD CEA Telstra Final | 69.004 RD CEA Monogoto Final |
| Boaroo | 69.005 Rayven Boaroo Telstra Final | **MISSING** |

The expected counterpart would be `69.006 Rayven Boaroo Monogoto Final.csv` (or similar `Data.mono` suffix). No such file exists anywhere in the repository.

### 4. Is there a Boaroo "CI clone" or "Rayven and CI clone" variant?

**No.** CEA has a "Rayven and CI clone" pair (61.140 Telstra + 61.141 DataMono). Komatsu has a "Rayven and CI clone" pair (61.133 Telstra + 61.135 DataMono). These dual-platform scripts allow devices to report to both CI and Rayven simultaneously during transition or for dual-visibility deployments.

Boaroo has no equivalent CI-clone script of either carrier. If Boaroo requires the same dual-platform visibility that CEA and Komatsu use, this is a gap.

### 5. Is there a demo script for Boaroo?

**No.** Keller has a dedicated demo/blank-APN script (`61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`). No demo, staging, or blank-APN pre-provisioning script exists for Boaroo. Given Boaroo's Telstra deployment, a blank-APN pre-provisioning script (where the APN is left empty to allow the device to use SIM default while being staged before deployment) would follow the same pattern as the Keller demo script.

### 6. Is the "General" 61.61 script still in active use or superseded?

The script targets `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` — the CI old-dashboard hostname. This endpoint is described explicitly in the filename as "old dashboard". Given that:
- All other Australian customer scripts have migrated to the 69.x Rayven series
- No "General for CI new dashboard datamono" exists as a replacement
- The 61.x series appears to be the generation prior to the 69.x Rayven finals

The 61.61 script is likely a legacy artifact. If any devices are still provisioned using it, they would be reporting to the deprecated CI old-dashboard endpoint. The status of this script (active/retired) is not documented anywhere in the repository.

## Findings

**A04-1** — HIGH: Boaroo Monogoto/DataMono carrier variant is missing

**Description:** Every other Australian customer with a Telstra Rayven script also has a paired Monogoto (DataMono APN: `data.mono`) variant. Komatsu has 69.001 (Telstra) + 69.002 (Monogoto). CEA has 69.003 (Telstra) + 69.004 (Monogoto). Boaroo has only 69.005 (Telstra) and no Monogoto counterpart. If any Boaroo devices are deployed with Monogoto/Kore SIMs (as used in 61.61, which uses `data.mono` APN), there is no script to provision them. The expected file would be `Aus Script/Boaroo/69.006 Rayven Boaroo Monogoto Final.csv` (or similarly named).

**Fix:** Create a Boaroo Monogoto variant based on 69.005 with parameter 2306,0 and 2306,1 set to `data.mono`, server IP/port updated to the Rayven platform's Monogoto-compatible endpoint, and the script identity byte (1024,1 / 1024,23) updated to reflect the new script number. Verify with the Boaroo/Rayven platform team which server endpoint is correct for Monogoto-SIM devices.

**A04-2** — MEDIUM: No Boaroo "Rayven and CI clone" dual-platform script

**Description:** CEA (61.140 + 61.141) and Komatsu (61.133 + 61.135) each have "Rayven and CI clone" scripts for both carriers, enabling devices to report simultaneously to both the CalAmp CI platform and the Rayven platform. Boaroo has no equivalent. If Boaroo was onboarded to Rayven without a transition period or if dual-visibility is a project requirement, this gap means Boaroo devices cannot be provisioned to report to both platforms simultaneously.

**Fix:** Confirm with the Boaroo project team whether a dual-platform (Rayven + CI clone) configuration is required. If yes, create `Aus Script/Boaroo/` scripts following the `61.1xx Rayven and CI clone Boaroo Telstra Final.csv` / `Rayven and CI clone Boaroo Data.mono Final.csv` naming pattern established by CEA and Komatsu.

---

**A04-3** — MEDIUM: No Boaroo demo or blank-APN pre-provisioning script

**Description:** Keller has `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` for staging and demonstration purposes. Boaroo has no demo script and no blank-APN pre-provisioning variant. A blank-APN script allows devices to be configured before SIM-specific APNs are known or before deployment, reducing the risk of mis-provisioning during staging. The Boaroo folder contains only the single production-final script.

**Fix:** Create `Aus Script/Boaroo/` a blank-APN pre-provisioning or demo script following the Keller pattern: omit or blank parameter 2306 (APN), and set the server to an appropriate staging or demo endpoint. This is particularly important if Boaroo devices are staged in a warehouse before carrier SIMs are finalised.

---

**A04-4** — LOW: 61.61 "old dashboard" script has no documented status or successor

**Description:** The file `Aus Script/61.61 General for CI old dashboard datamono.csv` is explicitly named as targeting the "old dashboard" endpoint (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`). No "new dashboard" General DataMono counterpart exists. The script's active/retired status is not documented anywhere in the repository. If any devices are currently provisioned using this script, they are reporting to a potentially deprecated CI endpoint. Additionally, no Telstra-APN "General" counterpart exists for this script at any vintage.

**Fix:** Add a comment file or README to the `Aus Script/` root documenting whether 61.61 is retired (and if so, what script replaced it), or whether it remains in active use as a bootstrap/template. If devices are still being provisioned with 61.61, a migration path to the Rayven-platform scripts should be documented. If the script is fully retired, it should either be moved to an `archive/` subfolder or removed from the active branch.

---

**A04-5** — LOW: 61.61 server endpoint differs structurally from all 69.x scripts (hostname vs IP address)

**Description:** The 61.61 "old dashboard" script uses a DNS hostname in parameter 2319,0 (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`). All 69.x Rayven Final scripts (69.001–69.005) use IP addresses in parameter 2319,0 (e.g., `52.164.241.179` in Boaroo 69.005). The 69.005 Boaroo script also has two representations of the same IP: parameter 768,0 stores `179.241.164.52` (little-endian decoded) while parameter 2319,0 stores `52.164.241.179` (dotted-decimal as ASCII). These are the same address but in different byte orders. Reliance on a hostname in 61.61 with no IP fallback means DNS failure would prevent connectivity — a risk not present in 69.x scripts where the IP is hardcoded directly.

**Fix:** This finding applies to 61.61 as a legacy risk. If 61.61 is still in active use, consider adding a hardcoded IP fallback for parameter 768,0 alongside the hostname in 2319,0. If 61.61 is retired, document it and archive the file.
