- Carrier: `Kore` / `Kore123`
- Username / password: `dummy` / `dummy`
- Dial string: `*99***1#`
- Dial number: `*22899`
- PIN: `*****`

**Server + port:** Identical to 62.371:

### FILE: `US Script/PAPE/69.007 Final POD SIMcard.csv`

**Row count:** 1241 data rows + 1 header = 1242 total lines (4 additional rows vs 63.137)

**APN + carrier credentials:** Same carrier core as 62.371 / 63.137:
- APN: `data641003` (Kore)
- Carrier: `Kore` / `Kore123`
- Username / password: `dummy` / `dummy`
- Dial string: `*99***1#`
- Dial number: `*22899`
- PIN: `*****`

**Server + port:**
- Server IP: `52.164.241.179` (same)
- Primary port: 1501, secondary ports: 20500 (same)

**Additional network params present in 69.007 only:**
- param 2310,0: `0x00000000` (new — network-related flag, zero)
- param 2311,0: `0x5014` = 20500 (new — explicit port setting)
- param 2320,0: `dm.calamp.com` (new — device management domain/FQDN, hex `646D2E63616C616D702E636F6D00`)
- param 2322,0: `0x00015180` = 86400 decimal = **86400 seconds = 24 hours** (new — keep-alive or check-in interval)

**Internal version stamp:**
- param 1024,1: `0x45` = **69** decimal (incremented from 63)
- param 1024,23: `0x07` = **7** decimal (changed from 137 in 63.137 — reset or re-indexed)

**Key differences from 63.137:** Five changes total (confirmed by diff):
1. `1024,1` incremented: `3F` → `45` (version 63 → 69)
2. `1024,23` changed: `0x89` (137) → `0x07` (7)
3. `2310,0` added: `00000000`
4. `2311,0` added: `5014` (port 20500)
5. `2320,0` added: `dm.calamp.com` (FQDN for device management)
6. `2322,0` added: `00015180` (86400 s = 24 h interval)

**param 2178,0** (identical across all three files):
Hex `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` decodes to `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` — tagged ATSP/script identifier string, unchanged across the entire Pod Fixed lineage.

## Coverage Analysis

### 1. What is the actual difference between 62.371 and 63.137?

They are effectively the same script. A machine-verified `diff` shows **exactly one byte changed**: param `1024,1` incremented from `0x3E` (62) to `0x3F` (63). Every other parameter — APN, carrier, server IP, port, all event rules (param 512), all motion parameters, all SIM card credentials — is identical. The filename version prefix (62 vs 63) matches the internal version counter exactly. The change represents a minor version bump with no functional or behavioral modification.

### 2. Is 69.007 the definitive current production script for PAPE?

Yes, by all indicators. It carries the highest internal version stamp (`1024,1` = 0x45 = 69), the highest filename version prefix, and is the only file in the set with a name that does not reference "Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed" — its name "Final POD SIMcard" signals it as a production-ready, SIM-provisioned variant. It also contains four additional parameters absent from all predecessors: explicit port config (2311), device management FQDN (`dm.calamp.com` via 2320), a 24-hour interval (2322), and a network flag (2310). These additions represent a mature, operationally complete configuration.

The change to `1024,23` from 0x89 (137) to 0x07 (7) between 63.137 and 69.007 is the most notable behavioral shift. This parameter (sub-index 23 of param 1024) likely controls a timing or mode value; the change from 137 to 7 represents a significant reduction and may indicate a different reporting cadence, power mode, or feature flag was tuned during the gap between version 63 and version 69.

### 3. Is the version chain clear: 62.137 → 62.371 → 63.137 → 69.007? What changed at each step?

The chain is partially clear from this agent's files. From the files assigned here:

| Step | Version (1024,1) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 62.371 | 62 (0x3E) | Baseline for this sub-chain; "Pod Fixed" correction from 62.137 |
| 63.137 | 63 (0x3F) | Single version bump only; no functional change |
| 69.007 | 69 (0x45) | Adds 2310, 2311, 2320 (dm.calamp.com), 2322 (86400s); resets 1024,23 from 137 to 7 |

The gap between version 63 and version 69 spans 6 increments with no intermediate files present in the repository. This suggests either intermediate versions were not committed, were produced externally, or version numbers were incremented in bulk. The jump is not explained by the files in the PAPE folder.

The 62.137 → 62.371 transition (assigned to A31) is not directly visible here, but the filenames imply 62.371 was a correction/fix of 62.137 within the same major version 62.

### 4. Are 62.371 and 63.137 now superseded by 69.007?

Yes. Both 62.371 and 63.137 are superseded by 69.007. They lack the device management FQDN (param 2320), the explicit port (2311), and the 86400-second interval (2322), all of which appear to be required for the fully provisioned production deployment. Since 62.371 and 63.137 are functionally identical to each other (single version-counter difference), keeping both is redundant. Neither adds coverage that is not provided by 69.007.

These files should be archived or removed. If a rollback reference is needed, only the most recent predecessor (63.137) needs to be retained.

### 5. Does 69.007 complete the PAPE coverage, or are there still missing variants?

69.007 appears to complete the Pod/SIMcard production coverage. However, from A31's analysis, the following gaps remain for the PAPE customer as a whole:

- **No confirmed Datamono production script**: 62.134 and 62.200 cover Datamono (with A31 noting 62.200 is misnamed but is actually Kore/Pod config). A clean, current Datamono production script analogous to 69.007 is not present. If Datamono hardware is still deployed, this is a coverage gap.
- **No CI (Continuous Integration / demo) variant at current version**: 62.134 is CI-labeled but sits at version 62. No CI variant at version 69 exists.
- **No demo script**: No explicitly "demo" labeled PAPE script exists in the folder. If PAPE devices are used for demos, a separate non-production demo script would be expected.

### 6. Is there a Datamono Pod Fixed counterpart for the 62.371/63.137 Pod Fixed family?

No. The "Pod Fixed" naming applies only to 62.371, 63.137, and (by lineage) 69.007. There is no `62.371 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv` or equivalent. The Datamono side of the PAPE set terminates at 62.200 (which A31 flags as misnamed). The Pod Fixed sub-family (62.371 → 63.137 → 69.007) has no Datamono mirror.

### 7. Is the PAPE set overly complex?

Yes. Six scripts for one customer (Rayven / PAPE) is disproportionate compared to what would be expected for a single GPS device customer. Contributing factors:

- Two hardware variants (Datamono vs Pod) multiplied by CI / production split
- Version accumulation without pruning (62.371 and 63.137 are near-identical and both retained alongside 69.007)
- A misnamed file (62.200 labeled "Datamono Fixed" but is Kore/Pod config per A31)
- No documented lifecycle policy that would govern when older versions are removed

By comparison, a well-maintained single-customer script set should consist of at most 2–3 files: one per hardware variant at the current production version, plus optionally one demo/CI variant.

## Findings

**A34-1** — CRITICAL: 62.371 and 63.137 are byte-for-byte duplicates except for a version counter increment

**Description:** `62.371 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv` and `63.137 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv` differ by exactly one line: `1024,1` changes from `0x3E` (62) to `0x3F` (63). All 1237 other rows are identical — same APN, same carrier, same server, same port, same all 512 event rules, same motion parameters. The two files carry different filename version prefixes but are functionally the same configuration. Retaining both in production creates ambiguity: a technician selecting between them has no basis to choose and may apply the older version.

**Fix:** Delete `62.371 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv`. It is fully superseded by 63.137, which is itself superseded by 69.007. If a rollback artifact is required, retain only 63.137. If 69.007 is confirmed production, consider whether 63.137 also needs to be retained or can also be removed.

---

**A34-2** — HIGH: 62.371 and 63.137 are both superseded by 69.007 and should be archived

**Description:** `69.007 Final POD SIMcard.csv` carries internal version 69 (vs 62 and 63), adds the device management FQDN `dm.calamp.com` (param 2320), an explicit port parameter (2311), a 24-hour interval (2322), and a network flag (2310) — none of which are present in 62.371 or 63.137. Devices provisioned using 62.371 or 63.137 would be missing the FQDN and interval configuration that 69.007 provides. Having all three files active in the same folder with no readme or lifecycle marker increases the risk of deploying an outdated script.

**Fix:** Move `62.371 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv` and `63.137 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv` into an `archive/` subdirectory under `US Script/PAPE/` or delete them outright if no rollback policy exists. Designate `69.007 Final POD SIMcard.csv` as the current production script.

---

**A34-3** — HIGH: `1024,23` changed from 137 (0x89) to 7 (0x07) between 63.137 and 69.007 with no documentation

**Description:** Sub-parameter `1024,23` drops from `0x89` (137) in both 62.371 and 63.137 to `0x07` (7) in 69.007. This is a significant value change of unknown intent. Param 1024 is a multi-byte device behavior block; sub-index 23 controls a feature flag or timing value that differs by a factor of approximately 20. There is no comment, changelog, or readme in the repository explaining this change. If this controls a reporting rate, power mode, or feature enablement, deploying 69.007 without understanding the change could alter device behavior in production.

**Fix:** Document the purpose of param `1024,23` in the PAPE script context (either in a file header comment or a separate changelog). Confirm the value `0x07` in 69.007 is intentional and correct for production deployment. If the change was inadvertent, restore to `0x89`.

---

**A34-4** — MEDIUM: No current production Datamono script exists for PAPE

**Description:** The Pod Fixed family (62.371 → 63.137 → 69.007) has a clear production endpoint. The Datamono side (62.134 and 62.200, the latter misnamed per A31) has no equivalent current-version production script. If PAPE Datamono hardware remains in active deployment, there is a coverage gap: no script at version 69 for Datamono. Technicians provisioning Datamono devices would be using version-62-era scripts while Pod devices are at version 69.

**Fix:** If Datamono hardware is still deployed, create a `69.xxx Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv` by adapting the Datamono-specific parameters from 62.200 into the version-69 base established by 69.007. If Datamono hardware has been retired, explicitly mark 62.134 and 62.200 as archived/deprecated.

---

**A34-5** — LOW: Version numbering gap between 63 and 69 is unexplained

**Description:** Internal version stamps (param `1024,1`) jump from 63 in 63.137 to 69 in 69.007, a span of 6 increments. No intermediate version files (64.xxx through 68.xxx) exist in the PAPE folder or anywhere in the repository. The gap may represent internal iterations that were never committed, or version numbers that were incremented during testing. Without a changelog, the history of changes during versions 64–68 cannot be audited.

**Fix:** Add a changelog comment or commit note describing what changed between version 63 and version 69. If intermediate scripts exist outside this repository, import or reference them. If version numbers were skipped intentionally, document the convention.

---

**A34-6** — LOW: param 2307,0 is `00` (null) in all three files — no description/label field set

**Description:** Param 2307 index 0 is present in 62.371 and 63.137 as `00` (a null/empty string). In 69.007 it is absent entirely. This parameter appears to be a free-text description or label field. An empty label field means there is no human-readable identifier embedded in the device configuration itself, making field identification reliant entirely on the filename.

**Fix:** Populate param 2307,0 with a short identifying string (e.g., the script name or customer tag) in 69.007 to make the configuration self-documenting when read from a provisioned device.
