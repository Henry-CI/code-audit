## Reading Evidence

### FILE: `Aus Script/CEA/61.141 Rayven and CI clone CEA data Mono Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1231 data rows (1232 lines including header)

**Purpose:** Standard-device (non-LMU1220) CEA configuration for Monogoto/DataMono carrier, routing primarily through the Rayven front-end with CI as a hot-standby.

**APN, server, port (decoded from hex):**

| Parameter | Hex Value | Decoded |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 2306,0 (APN slot 0) | `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` | `data.mono` |
| 2306,1 (APN slot 1) | `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` | `data.mono` |
| 2308,0 (APN user) | `4B6F726500` | `Kore` |
| 2309,0 (APN pass) | `4B6F726531323300` | `Kore123` |
| 2319,0 (server hostname 0) | `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` | `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (Rayven) |
| 2319,1 (server hostname 1) | `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` | `52.164.241.179` (CI backend) |
| 768,0 (server IP slot 0) | `6704EB0F` | `15.235.4.103` (Rayven front-end) |
| 768,1 (server IP slot 1) | `34A4F1B3` | `179.241.164.52` (CI backend) |
| 769,0 (port slot 0) | `2AF8` | `11000` (Rayven port) |
| 769,1 (port slot 1) | `05E0` | `1504` (CI backend port) |
| 2312,0 (UDP port) | `0011` | `17` |
| 2318,0 (phone/SMS) | `2A323238393900` | `*22899` |
| 3331,0 (PIN) | `2A2A2A2A2A00` | `*****` (masked) |
| 2178,0 (device tag) | `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` | `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` |
| 1024,1 (script profile ID) | `3D` | `61` (decimal — corresponds to 61.x script family) |
| 1024,23 (cellular tech flag) | `8D` | `0x8D = 10001101b` |

**Key difference from paired file (61.140 Telstra):**
Only two parameters differ from 61.140:
1. `2306,0` and `2306,1` are absent in 61.140 (Telstra uses the carrier default APN); 61.141 explicitly sets `data.mono` for both slots.
2. `1024,23` is `8C` in 61.140 and `8D` in 61.141 — a one-bit change, consistent with a carrier-select flag that increments between Telstra (8C) and DataMono (8D).

Server routing, all event rules (parameter 512), all trigger tables (parameters 513, 515), all I/O configuration, and all timing parameters are identical between 61.140 and 61.141. The pair is internally consistent.

### FILE: `Aus Script/CEA/69.003 RD CEA Telstra Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1228 data rows (1229 lines including header)

**Purpose:** "RD" (CI-only) CEA configuration for Telstra carrier. Routes exclusively to the CalAmp CI backend; the Rayven front-end is not present in either the IP table or the hostname table.

**APN, server, port (decoded from hex):**

| Parameter | Hex Value | Decoded |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 2306 | absent | No explicit APN (Telstra carrier default) |
| 2308,0 (APN user) | `4B6F726500` | `Kore` |
| 2309,0 (APN pass) | `4B6F726531323300` | `Kore123` |
| 2319,0 (server hostname 0) | `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` | `52.164.241.179` (CI backend, IP literal) |
| 768,0 (server IP slot 0) | `34A4F1B3` | `179.241.164.52` (CI backend) |
| 768,1–3 | `00000000` | unused |
| 769,0 (port slot 0) | `05E0` | `1504` |
| 769,1–3 | `5014` | `20500` (standby/unused) |
| 2312,0 (UDP port) | `0011` | `17` |
| 2318,0 (phone/SMS) | `2A323238393900` | `*22899` |
| 3331,0 (PIN) | `2A2A2A2A2A00` | `*****` (masked) |
| 2178,0 (device tag) | `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` | `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` |
| 1024,1 (script profile ID) | `45` | `69` (decimal — corresponds to 69.x script family) |
| 1024,23 (cellular tech flag) | `03` | `0x03 = 00000011b` |

**Key difference from 61.140/61.141 (Rayven+CI variants):**
- Rayven front-end (`6704EB0F` / `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) is entirely absent.
- Only the CI backend IP (`34A4F1B3` / `52.164.241.179`) is configured.
- `1024,1` is `0x45` (69) rather than `0x3D` (61) — different script family ID.
- `1024,23` is `0x03` rather than `0x8C`/`0x8D` — the high bit (0x80) is clear, which distinguishes RD/CI-only scripts from Rayven+CI scripts at the parameter level.
- All event rules (param 512), trigger tables (513, 515), I/O, and timing are otherwise identical to the 61.x files.

### FILE: `Aus Script/CEA/69.004 RD CEA Monogoto Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1230 data rows (1231 lines including header)

**Purpose:** "RD" (CI-only) CEA configuration for Monogoto/DataMono carrier. Routes exclusively to the CalAmp CI backend. The Monogoto carrier pair to 69.003 (Telstra).

**APN, server, port (decoded from hex):**

| Parameter | Hex Value | Decoded |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 2306,0 (APN slot 0) | `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` | `data.mono` |
| 2306,1 (APN slot 1) | `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` | `data.mono` |
| 2308,0 (APN user) | `4B6F726500` | `Kore` |
| 2309,0 (APN pass) | `4B6F726531323300` | `Kore123` |
| 2319,0 (server hostname 0) | `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` | `52.164.241.179` (CI backend, IP literal) |
| 768,0 (server IP slot 0) | `34A4F1B3` | `179.241.164.52` (CI backend) |
| 768,1–3 | `00000000` | unused |
| 769,0 (port slot 0) | `05E0` | `1504` |
| 2312,0 (UDP port) | `0011` | `17` |
| 2318,0 (phone/SMS) | `2A323238393900` | `*22899` |
| 3331,0 (PIN) | `2A2A2A2A2A00` | `*****` (masked) |
| 2178,0 (device tag) | `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` | `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` |
| 1024,1 (script profile ID) | `45` | `69` (decimal) |
| 1024,23 (cellular tech flag) | `04` | `0x04 = 00000100b` |

**Key difference from 69.003 (Telstra):**
Only two differences from 69.003:
1. `2306,0` and `2306,1` are absent in 69.003 (Telstra default APN); 69.004 explicitly sets `data.mono` for both slots.
2. `1024,23` is `0x03` in 69.003 and `0x04` in 69.004 — same one-bit carrier increment pattern seen between 61.140 (8C) and 61.141 (8D).

The 69.003 / 69.004 pair is internally consistent: identical in all parameters except APN and carrier-select flag.

---

## Coverage Analysis

### 1. Does 61.141 (DataMono) complete the pair with 61.140 (Telstra)?

**Yes, unambiguously.** The diff between 61.140 and 61.141 is exactly two changes: addition of `2306,0` and `2306,1` set to `data.mono`, and a one-bit increment in `1024,23` (carrier flag 8C → 8D). Every other parameter — all 1229+ rows — is byte-identical. The pair is correct and complete.

### 2. What do the 69.003/69.004 "RD" scripts cover that 61.140/61.141 do not?

The "RD" scripts are **CI-only** configurations (no Rayven front-end). The primary server in 69.003 and 69.004 is `179.241.164.52` (CalAmp CI backend); the Rayven front-end IP `15.235.4.103` and hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` are entirely absent. By contrast, 61.140 and 61.141 route primarily through Rayven (`15.235.4.103:11000`) and fall back to CI (`179.241.164.52:1504`).

The `1024,23` byte distinguishes the two families at the firmware parameter level: Rayven+CI scripts have the high bit set (values `0x8C`/`0x8D`); CI-only scripts have it clear (values `0x03`/`0x04`).

Additionally, `1024,1` encodes the script family number: `0x3D` (61) for the 61.x Rayven+CI family, `0x45` (69) for the 69.x RD/CI-only family.

The RD scripts are **not** redundant duplicates of the 61.x scripts — they represent a genuinely different deployment topology (CI-only vs Rayven+CI).

### 3. Do the 69.x scripts have a CI-only counterpart as DPWorld has?

The comparison requires care. DPWorld 61.36 and 61.37 are labelled "CI DPWORLD" but actually route **to Rayven** (`6704EB0F = 15.235.4.103`) as their primary IP. The CEA 69.003/69.004 scripts route to the CI backend as their primary IP with no Rayven present at all. So:

- **DPWorld 61.36/61.37**: Rayven-primary, labelled CI — no separate CI-only RD variant exists.
- **CEA 69.003/69.004**: Genuinely CI-only — no separate Rayven-primary variant within the 69.x family (that is served by 61.140/61.141).

The CEA set therefore has **more** complete separation between the two platform modes than DPWorld. There is no missing "pure CI-only" counterpart for CEA — 69.003/69.004 fill that role.

### 4. Is the full CEA matrix covered?

| Dimension | Telstra | DataMono / Monogoto |
|---|---|---|
| **LMU1220 provisioning** | 50.131 (A06) | 50.132 (A06) |
| **Standard — Rayven+CI** | 61.140 (A06) | 61.141 (this agent) |
| **Standard — RD/CI-only** | 69.003 (A10) | 69.004 (A11) |
| **Demo / Blank-APN** | ABSENT | 61.142 (Demo Script folder, DataMono only) |

The functional operational matrix (LMU1220, Rayven+CI, RD/CI-only across both carriers) is **fully covered** by 6 files. The one gap is the demo/blank-APN layer (see Finding A09-1 below).

### 5. Is there a demo script for CEA?

Partially. `Demo Script/61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` (1230 data rows) carries the CEA device tag (`<EA><S0><=*><T1>`), sets `data.mono` APN, uses the CI backend as primary (`34A4F1B3:1503`), has `1024,1 = 0x3D` (61-family profile ID), and has no Rayven front-end IP. Despite its name "Demo Rayven datamono", it is functionally a CI-only demo on DataMono.

Two gaps remain:
- No demo script for CEA on **Telstra** carrier.
- No demo script for **RD/CI-only** CEA (69.x family, `1024,1 = 0x45`).
- The existing demo's name ("Demo Rayven datamono") is misleading: it does not route through Rayven; it is CI-only.

## Findings

**A09-1** — LOW: No CEA demo script for Telstra carrier; existing demo name is misleading

**Description:** `Demo Script/61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` is the only demo/testing script for CEA. It covers only the DataMono carrier and only the CI-only routing topology. There is no corresponding demo for Telstra. Additionally, the filename contains "Rayven" but the script routes exclusively to the CI backend (`34A4F1B3`), not to the Rayven front-end; this contradicts the naming convention used by all other Rayven-primary files in the repository.

**Fix:**
1. Rename `61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` to remove "Rayven" from the filename (e.g., `61.142 Demo CI DataMono CEA.csv`) to accurately reflect its CI-only routing.
2. Create a companion demo script `61.143 Demo CI Telstra CEA.csv` for Telstra (omit `2306` APN rows, set `1024,23` to `0x03` to mirror the Telstra pattern in 61.140/69.003).

---

**A09-2** — INFO: No RD-family (69.x) demo script for CEA

**Description:** The demo coverage in `Demo Script/` provides a 61-family (profile ID `0x3D`) demo for CEA but nothing for the 69-family (profile ID `0x45`) RD/CI-only configuration. If technicians need to verify an RD deployment without live connectivity, there is no reference demo script for that family.

**Fix:** Consider adding a `69.005 RD CEA Demo DataMono.csv` and/or `69.006 RD CEA Demo Telstra.csv` in the `Demo Script/` folder, mirroring the structure of 69.003/69.004 but with a blank or test APN. Accept as low priority if RD deployments are always provisioned directly from the 69.003/69.004 production scripts.

---

**A09-3** — INFO: 61.140 filename contains a typographical error ("Telsta" instead of "Telstra")

**Description:** The paired Telstra script is named `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telsta Final.csv` (missing the letter "r" in Telstra). This is a cosmetic issue that does not affect device configuration but will cause confusion when comparing filenames across customer folders or searching the repository.

**Fix:** Rename to `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telstra Final.csv` (correct spelling). Update any references in provisioning documentation.

---

**A09-4** — INFO: 69.003/69.004 use an IP literal as the primary server hostname rather than a DNS name

**Description:** In parameter `2319,0`, the 61.x scripts set `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (a DNS hostname) as the primary connection target, which allows server migration without re-scripting. The 69.003 and 69.004 scripts set `52.164.241.179` (a bare IP address). If the CI backend migrates to a new IP, all deployed RD-CEA devices will need to be re-provisioned.

**Fix:** Replace the IP literal in `2319,0` of 69.003 and 69.004 with the authoritative DNS hostname for the CI backend, if one is available in the platform infrastructure. If only an IP is available today, document the risk and track the IP against a configuration management record.
