- Platform: Rayven + CI clone (dual-server, dual-port configuration)
- APN: Not explicitly set in script

**Server + port:**
- param 768,0 = `6704EB0F` → `103.4.235.15` (primary server — Rayven AU endpoint)

### FILE: `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/61.135 Rayven and CI clone Komatsu Data.mono Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1232 (including header) — 2 rows more than 61.133

**Carrier, platform, APN:**
- Carrier: Data.mono / Monogoto
- Platform: Rayven + CI clone (same dual-server architecture as 61.133)
- APN: `data.mono` (param 2306,0 and 2306,1 both explicitly set to `data.mono`)

**Server + port:**

**Other decoded strings:**
- param 2308,0 = `Kore`, param 2309,0 = `Kore123`, param 2318,0 = `*22899` (all identical to 61.133)
- param 2306,0 = `data.mono`, param 2306,1 = `data.mono` (ADDITIONAL rows vs 61.133 — these account for the +2 row difference)
- param 1024,1 = `0x3D` = decimal 61 (identical to 61.133)
- param 1024,23 = `0x87` vs `0x85` in 61.133 (minor flag difference — carrier capability byte)

### FILE: `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/69.001 RD Komatsu Telstra Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1229 (including header) — 1 row fewer than 61.133

**Carrier, platform, APN:**
- Carrier: Telstra (no APN set — param 2306 absent, same as 61.133)
- Platform: RD (Remote Desktop / different device firmware series — param 1024,1 = `0x45` = decimal 69, matching the 69.x script series)
- APN: Not explicitly set

**Server + port:**
- param 768,0 = `34A4F1B3` → `52.164.241.179` (PRIMARY is now the Azure/CI IP — no Rayven primary)
- param 768,1 = `00000000` → `0.0.0.0` (no secondary server configured)
- param 769,0 = `0x05DC` = **1500** (primary port — matches CI port, not Rayven port 11000)
- param 769,1 = `0x5014` = **20500** (secondary port)
- param 2319,0: `52.164.241.179` only — NO hostname entry (no `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`)
- param 2319,1: MISSING (only one server entry)

**Other decoded strings:**
- param 2308,0 = `Kore`, param 2309,0 = `Kore123`, param 2318,0 = `*22899` (identical to 61.x)
- param 1024,1 = `0x45` = decimal 69 (RD device series — this is the key device-model differentiator)
- param 1024,23 = `0x01` (different from both 61.x files — RD-specific flag)

## Coverage Analysis

### Does the 61.133/61.135 Telstra/DataMono pair form a complete carrier set?

Yes, for the Rayven+CI-clone platform, the Telstra (61.133) and Data.mono (61.135) pair covers the two AU carriers used in this deployment. The scripts are structurally identical except for:
1. The APN parameter (2306) — absent for Telstra, set to `data.mono` for Data.mono/Monogoto.
2. A single flag byte difference at param 1024,23 (`0x85` vs `0x87`).

This is the expected and correct pattern for a carrier-pair set.

### What distinguishes 69.001 (RD) from 61.133 (Rayven+CI-clone)?

The 69.001 file represents a **different device firmware/model series** (the "RD" prefix), confirmed by:
- param 1024,1 = `0x45` (69 decimal) vs `0x3D` (61 decimal) — this is the script/device series byte
- **Different server configuration**: 69.001 targets only the CI/Azure IP (`52.164.241.179`) at port 1500 as primary, with no Rayven platform server configured at all
- **No hostname**: 69.001 only has an IP address in param 2319 — it lacks the `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` Rayven hostname
- **Different port set**: primary port is 1500 (CI) instead of 11000 (Rayven)

The RD scripts are CI-only (no Rayven dual-server), running on a different LMU firmware line. The 61.x scripts are Rayven+CI-clone (dual-server, dual-platform). These are two distinct device/platform tiers, not alternative configurations of the same device.

### Is the 61.x + 69.x combination the expected full set, or is a CI-only (no Rayven) 61.x variant also needed?

Based on observed patterns across the repository:
- The **61.x Komatsu** series is exclusively "Rayven and CI clone" — no CI-only 61.x variant exists for Komatsu.
- The **RD (69.x) series** is the CI-only path for Komatsu.
- The DPWorld subfolder provides a comparison: `61.36 CI DPWORLD Telstra` and `61.37 CI DPWORLD Data.mono` exist as CI-only 61.x scripts, showing the CI-only 61.x pattern does exist in the repo for other clients.
- **For Komatsu specifically**, there is no CI-only 61.x script. This is either by design (Komatsu AU only uses Rayven+CI-clone for the 61.x tier) or a gap.

The combination of 61.133 + 61.135 + 69.001 + 69.002 (assigned to A19) represents a complete four-script set: two carriers × two device tiers.

### Are there missing variants: LMU1220 provisioning scripts? Demo? Blank-APN?

**LMU1220:** The CEA subfolder has `50.131 LMU1220 units.csv` and `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv`, indicating LMU1220 provisioning scripts exist as a separate 50.x series. No LMU1220 script exists for Komatsu AU. Whether one is needed depends on whether Komatsu AU deploys LMU1220 hardware. This is a **potential gap** that cannot be confirmed from the scripts alone.

**Demo / Blank-APN:** The Keller subfolder has `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`, demonstrating a demo/blank-APN pattern exists in the repo. No equivalent demo or blank-APN script exists for Komatsu AU. This variant is absent.

**CI-only Telstra 61.x for Komatsu:** No `61.xxx CI Komatsu Telstra` script exists. DPWorld has this pattern but Komatsu does not.

**CI-only DataMono 61.x for Komatsu:** No `61.xxx CI Komatsu Data.mono` script exists.

### Row count / parameter set comparison

All three files cover the same broad parameter set (parameter IDs 256 through 3333). The row count differences are minor and fully accounted for:
- 61.135 has 2 extra rows (the two 2306 APN rows for `data.mono`)
- 69.001 has 1 fewer row than 61.133 (missing `2319,1` because it only has one server entry)

The parameter structures are otherwise identical across the three files, confirming they were generated from the same template with per-variant substitutions applied.

## Findings

**A16-1** — INFO: Carrier set for 61.x (Rayven+CI-clone) is complete
**Description:** The Telstra (61.133) and Data.mono (61.135) scripts form a correctly matched carrier pair. APN is the only intentional difference (absent for Telstra, `data.mono` for Data.mono/Monogoto). Server, port, hostname, and all behavioral parameters are identical between the two. No gaps in this pair.
**Fix:** No action required.

---

**A16-2** — INFO: 69.001 (RD) is CI-only, not Rayven+CI-clone — this is by design
**Description:** The 69.001 RD Telstra script targets a different LMU device firmware series (param 1024,1 = 0x45 = 69 vs 0x3D = 61). It connects only to the CI server (`52.164.241.179:1500`) with no Rayven platform configured. The hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` is absent. This is consistent with the "RD" designation representing a distinct device tier with a different platform target.
**Fix:** No action required as long as deployment documentation distinguishes RD-tier devices from 61.x-tier devices to prevent accidental cross-flashing.

---

**A16-3** — LOW: No Komatsu AU demo / blank-APN script exists
**Description:** The Keller subfolder contains `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`, establishing a precedent for demo or staging scripts with a blank APN. No equivalent demo or blank-APN script exists for Komatsu AU. Absence of such a script means field technicians have no safe staging configuration to load on Komatsu hardware before live provisioning.
**Fix:** Create a `61.xxx Demo Blank APN Komatsu.csv` based on 61.133, with APN, server credentials, and password fields cleared, following the pattern in `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`.

---

**A16-4** — LOW: No LMU1220 provisioning scripts exist for Komatsu AU
**Description:** The CEA subfolder contains `50.131 LMU1220 units.csv` and `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv` as LMU1220-specific provisioning scripts. Komatsu AU has no 50.x series scripts. If any Komatsu AU deployments use LMU1220 hardware, the available 61.x and 69.x scripts cannot be used (wrong firmware series byte at param 1024,1). This is potentially a gap if the Komatsu AU hardware mix includes LMU1220 units.
**Fix:** Confirm whether Komatsu AU deploys any LMU1220 devices. If so, create `50.xxx LMU1220 Komatsu Telstra.csv` and `50.xxx LMU1220 Komatsu Data.mono.csv` following the CEA 50.x pattern.

---

**A16-5** — LOW: No CI-only 61.x scripts exist for Komatsu AU
**Description:** DPWorld has CI-only 61.x scripts (`61.36 CI DPWORLD Telstra Final.csv`, `61.37 CI DPWORLD Data.mono Final.csv`) for 61-series devices that connect only to the CI platform without Rayven. Komatsu AU has no CI-only 61.x equivalent — all 61.x Komatsu scripts are "Rayven and CI clone". If a Komatsu AU device needs to be configured for CI-only operation on 61.x firmware (e.g., Rayven subscription lapses or for specific CI-only fleets), no suitable script exists.
**Fix:** Assess whether CI-only 61.x scripts are operationally required for Komatsu AU. If so, create `61.xxx CI Komatsu Telstra Final.csv` and `61.xxx CI Komatsu Data.mono Final.csv` following the DPWorld pattern, with the Rayven primary server replaced by the CI server at port 1500.

---

**A16-6** — MEDIUM: 69.001 (RD Telstra) has no hostname — IP-only server entry is a resilience risk
**Description:** Unlike the 61.x scripts which configure both a DNS hostname (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) and an IP fallback (`52.164.241.179`) in param 2319, the 69.001 RD script configures only a bare IP address (`52.164.241.179`) in param 2319,0 with no hostname entry. If the Azure IP address changes (e.g., due to a cloud re-IP or region failover), 69.001-configured devices will lose connectivity and there is no DNS-based failover path. The 61.x scripts are protected from this scenario by the hostname entry.
**Fix:** Add a DNS hostname entry to param 2319,0 of 69.001 (and the companion 69.002 RD Monogoto file when reviewed) so it resolves to the CI server by name, reserving the IP as a fallback in param 2319,1. Confirm the correct CI hostname with the platform team.
