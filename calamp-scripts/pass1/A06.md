### FILE: `Aus Script/CEA/61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telsta Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1231 (including header)
**Column structure:** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value` — 3 columns; significantly larger file covering additional parameter blocks (registers 513, 515, 768, 779, 902-909, 913, 1052-1056, 1281-1282, 2178, 3072-3074, 3328-3333)

**All decoded server endpoints (IPs, hostnames, ports):**
- Register 2319,0 (primary server): `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`
- Register 2319,1 (secondary server): `52.164.241.179`
- Register 2311 (port): not explicitly present; register 2312,0 = `0011` (hex) = 17 decimal (likely a protocol/mode field, not a port)

**All decoded APN names:**
- Register 2306: not present in this file

**APN username — decoded value:** Register 2314 not present in this file.

**APN password — decoded value:** Register 2315 not present in this file.

**Register 2308,0 value — decoded:** hex `4B6F726500` = `Kore`
(Kore is a known IoT/M2M connectivity provider / carrier name. This is an operator/carrier name field.)

**Register 2309,0 value — decoded:** hex `4B6F726531323300` = `Kore123`
(This is a short alphanumeric string committed in plaintext. Format is consistent with a PIN, password, or access code. The value `Kore123` follows a carrier-name-plus-digits pattern typical of default or weak credentials.)

**Register 3331,0 value — decoded:** hex `2A2A2A2A2A00` = `*****`
(Five asterisks — a masked/redacted placeholder. This register appears to hold a value that has been intentionally obscured in the script.)

**Register 2318,0 (asterisk/masked field):** hex `2A323238393900` = `*22899`

**Register 2178,0 (special config field):** hex `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` = `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`
(This appears to be a modem AT-command initialization or configuration string in a structured tag format. Not a credential, but included for completeness.)

**Other credential-like values:** Register 2309,0 `Kore123` — see findings below.

## Findings

### 50.131 LMU1220 units.csv

**A06-1** — HIGH: Plaintext server hostname committed to repository

**Description:** Register 2319,0 in `50.131 LMU1220 units.csv` contains the production server hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` encoded as a null-terminated hex string and committed to the git repository. Register 2319,1 contains the fallback IP address `52.164.241.179`. Port 20500 (register 2311,0) is also committed. Together these fully identify the production telematics ingest endpoint. Any party with read access to this repository can enumerate the live fleet-tracking infrastructure target.

**Fix:** Move server endpoint configuration out of version-controlled CSV scripts and into a secrets-management system or deployment-time variable substitution. If the hostname must appear in scripts, restrict repository access to authorised personnel only and document the exposure in a risk register.

---

**A06-2** — MEDIUM: IP address used as secondary/fallback server endpoint

**Description:** Register 2319,1 = `52.164.241.179` is a raw IP address rather than a hostname. Hardcoded IP addresses bypass DNS-based certificate validation and make rotation difficult without re-flashing devices. The same IP appears as both primary and secondary endpoint in `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv` (see A06-4).

**Fix:** Replace the raw IP fallback with a DNS hostname that can be updated independently of device firmware. Ensure TLS certificate pinning or hostname-based validation is in place.

---

Checklist item 3 (APN credentials — reg 2306/2314/2315): No issues found. Registers 2306, 2314, and 2315 are absent from `50.131 LMU1220 units.csv`; no APN name, username, or password is present.

Checklist item 4 (Register 2309 credential-like value): No issues found in this file. Register 2309 is absent.

Checklist item 5 (Register 3331 masked value): No issues found in this file. Register 3331 is absent.

---

### 50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv

**A06-3** — MEDIUM: Primary and secondary server both set to same IP address — no meaningful failover

**Description:** In `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv`, both register 2319,0 and register 2319,1 are set to the same value `52.164.241.179`. This means the device has no actual failover path; if the primary endpoint becomes unreachable, the secondary will also fail. This is both an operational resilience issue and, from a security standpoint, indicates these scripts may have been produced with a copy-paste approach without validation — raising the question of whether credentials or other sensitive values were similarly duplicated without review.

**Fix:** Configure a geographically or topologically distinct secondary server endpoint. Review all scripts generated with this template for other duplicated or placeholder values.

---

**A06-4** — HIGH: Plaintext server IP address committed to repository

**Description:** Register 2319,0 and 2319,1 in `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv` both contain the production IP address `52.164.241.179` committed to the git repository. Combined with port 20500, the full ingest endpoint for the Rayven-connected fleet is exposed.

**Fix:** Same as A06-1: move endpoint configuration out of version-controlled scripts. Restrict repository access.

---

Checklist item 3 (APN credentials — reg 2306/2314/2315): No issues found. Registers 2306, 2314, and 2315 are absent from `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv`.

Checklist item 4 (Register 2309 credential-like value): No issues found in this file. Register 2309 is absent.

Checklist item 5 (Register 3331 masked value): No issues found in this file. Register 3331 is absent.

### 61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telsta Final.csv

**A06-5** — CRITICAL: Plaintext credential committed to repository (register 2309)

**Description:** Register 2309,0 in `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telsta Final.csv` decodes from hex `4B6F726531323300` to the string `Kore123`. Register 2308,0 decodes to `Kore`, identifying the carrier/operator as Kore (an M2M/IoT connectivity provider). The value `Kore123` in the field documented as a possible credential or operator code is a weak, predictable default-style string following the pattern `[carrier-name][digits]`. It is committed in plaintext (hex-encoded but trivially decoded) to the git repository's main branch. If this value is an APN password, SIM PIN, or account access code for the Kore platform, it represents a directly exploitable credential exposure.

**Fix:** Immediately determine whether `Kore123` is an active credential (APN password, SIM management PIN, or Kore portal access code). If active: rotate the credential immediately on the Kore platform and on all affected devices. Purge the value from git history using `git filter-repo` or BFG Repo Cleaner. Replace the hardcoded value in future scripts with a placeholder populated at deployment time from a secrets vault.

---

**A06-6** — HIGH: Plaintext server hostname committed to repository

**Description:** Register 2319,0 in `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telsta Final.csv` contains `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (same hostname as in 50.131). Register 2319,1 contains `52.164.241.179`. The full production ingest endpoint for this configuration is exposed in the repository.

**Fix:** Same as A06-1.

---

**A06-7** — LOW: Register 3331 contains asterisk-masked value

**Description:** Register 3331,0 decodes to `*****` (five asterisk characters). This appears to be a placeholder or a value that has been intentionally masked in the script file, suggesting that a real value was known at script-creation time and was deliberately replaced before committing. The asterisk masking is not a cryptographic protection — it is a display convention. The intent to mask implies the original value was considered sensitive. The actual value is not present in the file, so no direct credential exposure exists here; however, it is unclear what mechanism will substitute the real value at device-provisioning time, or whether this masking is consistent across all files in the repository.

**Fix:** Document the provisioning workflow that substitutes the masked `*****` value. Confirm whether all files requiring this value have it masked (or templated) consistently. Ensure the real value is sourced only from a secrets manager and never appears in any committed file.

---

**A06-8** — INFO: Register 2318 across all three files contains `*22899`

**Description:** All three files set register 2318,0 to hex `2A323238393900`, decoding to `*22899`. This appears to be a dial string or MSISDN-prefixed numeric code (asterisk followed by digits). It is consistent across all three files. While not itself a credential, it is an operational identifier committed to the repository that could assist in mapping the carrier/network identity of these devices.

**Fix:** No immediate action required. Document whether `*22899` is a shared network identifier and assess whether its exposure in a public-facing or broadly accessible repository is acceptable per the organisation's data classification policy.

---

**A06-9** — INFO: Register 2178 contains a structured configuration tag string

**Description:** Register 2178,0 in `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telsta Final.csv` decodes to `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`. This appears to be a device initialisation or AT-command tag sequence. The `<=*>` segment contains an asterisk that may represent a wildcard or masked field within the tag syntax. This is not a credential but warrants awareness during provisioning review.

**Fix:** Confirm the intended value for the `<=*>` segment and ensure it does not represent a masked password or access token within the tag-command framework.
