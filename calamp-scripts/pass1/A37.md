## Reading Evidence

**FILE:** C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/US Script/SIE/69.006 Rayven SIE Datamono Final.csv

**Row count:** 1229 data rows (plus 1 header row = 1230 total lines)

**All decoded server endpoints (IPs, hostnames, ports):**
- Register 2319,0 (Primary server): `52.164.241.179` (decoded from `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900`)
- Register 2320 (Secondary server): NOT PRESENT in file
- Register 2311 (Server port, explicit): NOT PRESENT in file
- Register 2312,0 (port-related field): raw `0011` = decimal 17 (consistent with PAPE and Matthai scripts; not a standard application port number on its own — likely a sub-field or mode flag, not the TCP destination port)
- Register 2313,0: raw `0000` = decimal 0

**All decoded APN names:**
- Register 2306,0: `data.mono` (decoded from `646174612E6D6F6E6F00`)
- Register 2306,1: `data.mono` (decoded from `646174612E6D6F6E6F00`) — both indices set identically

**APN username (decoded):**
- Register 2314: NOT PRESENT — blank/not configured

**APN password (decoded):**
- Register 2315: NOT PRESENT — blank/not configured

**Register 2309 value (decoded):**
- Register 2309: NOT PRESENT in file — absent entirely

**Register 3331 value (decoded):**
- Register 3331,0: `*****` (decoded from `2A2A2A2A2A00`) — five asterisk characters; same masked/placeholder pattern seen in PAPE and Matthai scripts

**Other credential-like values:**
- Register 2308 (Operator/carrier): NOT PRESENT
- Register 2318,0: `*22899` (decoded from `2A323238393900`) — appears to be a GSM supplementary service code / USSD string (a carrier-side activation command), not a device credential
- Register 2178,0: decoded to `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` — appears to be a message template or internal tag structure; not a credential
- Register 2307,0: raw `00` — empty/null string

**How does this file compare to the PAPE and Matthai US scripts?**

The SIE script shares several characteristics with the Matthai DataMono scripts:
- Identical APN name: `data.mono` (same as Matthai 61.138; PAPE uses `data641003`)
- Identical primary server IP: `52.164.241.179` (same across all three customer families)
- Identical `3331,0` value: `*****` (same in all scripts reviewed)
- Identical `2312,0` value: `0011` and `2313,0`: `0000` (same in PAPE and Matthai)
- Identical `2318,0` value: `*22899` (same in PAPE and Matthai)

Key differences from PAPE scripts:
- SIE does NOT contain register 2309 (`Kore123` credential present in PAPE scripts such as 62.200)
- SIE does NOT contain register 2308 (operator name `Kore` in PAPE)
- SIE does NOT contain registers 2314/2315 (PAPE has `dummy` username/password placeholders)
- SIE is structurally cleaner from a credential exposure standpoint than the PAPE family

The SIE script is the only file in the US Script/SIE/ folder and is a DataMono-type configuration (uses `data.mono` APN consistent with Datamono SIM provider).

## Security Review

**Checklist item 1 (Hardcoded credentials — register 2309):** Register 2309 is NOT present in this file. The `Kore123` credential that appears in PAPE scripts is absent. No issues found.

**Checklist item 2 (APN credentials — registers 2314/2315):** Neither register 2314 (APN username) nor 2315 (APN password) is present. No APN credentials are configured or exposed. No issues found.

**Checklist item 3 (APN name exposure — register 2306):** The APN name `data.mono` is set in both index 0 and index 1. This is a provider APN name that identifies the SIM/carrier service (Datamono). Exposure of the APN name alone is low risk — it does not grant access — but it does identify the network provider, which is minor information disclosure.

**Checklist item 4 (Server endpoint exposure — registers 2319/2320):** The primary server IP `52.164.241.179` is present in plaintext. This is a shared endpoint also used in PAPE and Matthai scripts (Azure-hosted based on the IP range). No secondary server (2320) is configured. The IP is an Azure cloud address and is not a private/internal endpoint. Exposure is consistent across multiple customer scripts.

**Checklist item 5 (Register 3331 masked value):** Register 3331,0 contains `*****` — the same masked placeholder pattern seen in other US scripts. The underlying value is obscured. The presence of masking rather than a null value suggests the field was intentionally hidden, possibly containing a PIN, password, or activation code. The masked format means the actual credential is not exposed in the script file.

**Checklist item 6 (Register 2318 USSD/service code):** Register 2318,0 contains `*22899`, which is a USSD/GSM supplementary service code. This is a carrier activation string, not a device credential. It is identical across all US scripts reviewed. No issues found.

**Checklist item 7 (No secondary server configured):** Register 2320 is absent — there is no secondary/fallback server configured. If the primary server `52.164.241.179` becomes unavailable, devices will have no failover target. This is an operational resilience concern but not a direct security vulnerability.

**Checklist item 8 (Credential register 2309 absent — comparison note):** The absence of register 2309 (`Kore123`) in the SIE script, compared to its presence in PAPE scripts, is a positive finding. The SIE script does not carry the known shared credential that represents the highest-severity finding in the PAPE family.

## Findings

**A37-1** — LOW: APN name `data.mono` exposed in plaintext across two indices
**Description:** Registers 2306,0 and 2306,1 both contain the APN name `data.mono` in plaintext hex encoding. While an APN name alone does not grant network access, it identifies the SIM/carrier provider (Datamono) and narrows the attack surface for targeted cellular interception or SIM-swap attempts. The same APN is also present in the Matthai DataMono scripts, indicating it is a shared infrastructure detail across multiple customers.
**Fix:** APN names cannot be encrypted in CalAmp configuration format. Ensure access to script files in version control is restricted to authorized personnel only. Consider whether the repository requires stricter access controls (private repo, need-to-know basis).

**A37-2** — LOW: Primary server IP `52.164.241.179` exposed in plaintext
**Description:** Register 2319,0 contains the primary server IP `52.164.241.179` in plaintext. This endpoint is shared across SIE, PAPE, and Matthai customer scripts. An adversary with access to this file can identify the data collection server. The IP resolves to an Azure-hosted endpoint. While the server is presumably hardened and access-controlled at the application layer, knowing the endpoint enables targeted probing or DoS attempts.
**Fix:** This is inherent to the device configuration format. Restrict repository access. Consider documenting that this IP is a known shared asset requiring appropriate network-layer protection (IP allowlisting on the server side, rate limiting, etc.).

**A37-3** — INFO: Register 3331,0 contains masked value `*****`
**Description:** Register 3331,0 is set to `2A2A2A2A2A00` which decodes to five asterisk characters (`*****`). This same pattern appears in PAPE and Matthai scripts. The actual underlying value is unknown — the masking pattern may indicate a PIN, password, or activation code that was substituted with asterisks before the script was committed to the repository. This is a positive security control (the real value is not present), but the existence of the field and its apparent masking warrants noting.
**Fix:** Document what register 3331 controls and confirm that the `*****` placeholder is intentional and that the real value is provisioned through a separate secure channel (e.g., over-the-air configuration or direct device programming). Verify that the device does not interpret `*****` literally.

**A37-4** — INFO: No secondary server configured (register 2320 absent)
**Description:** Register 2320 (secondary server hostname/IP) is not present in this script. If the primary server `52.164.241.179` is unreachable, devices have no fallback communications path. This is an operational resilience gap rather than a direct security vulnerability, but loss of telemetry could mask device tampering or theft events.
**Fix:** Evaluate whether a secondary server endpoint should be configured for SIE devices, consistent with any redundancy requirements in the customer SLA.

**A37-5** — INFO: Registers 2308, 2309, 2314, 2315 absent — no Kore credential exposure
**Description:** Unlike the PAPE script family (e.g., 62.200 which contains `Kore123` in register 2309), the SIE script does not contain register 2309 or any APN credential registers. This is a positive finding: the highest-severity credential class identified in the PAPE audit is not present here.
**Fix:** No action required. Document this as a confirmed clean state for future audits.
