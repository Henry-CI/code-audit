**All decoded server endpoints:**
- 2319[0] (primary server): `52.164.241.179` (IP address)
- 2319[1] (secondary server): `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (hostname)
- No register 2311 (port) present — port not explicitly configured in this file
- No register 2320 (secondary server IP) present

**All decoded APN names:**
- 2306[0]: `data.mono`
- 2306[1]: `data.mono`

**APN username (2314):** Not present in this file (register absent)

**APN password (2315):** Not present in this file (register absent)

**Register 2309 value:** Not present in this file (register absent)

**Register 3331 value:** `*****` (decoded from `2A2A2A2A2A00`) — masked/unknown field

**Other credential-like values:**

**What changed between 62.134 (Datamono) and 62.200 (Datamono Fixed):**

Despite being labeled "Datamono Fixed," file 62.200 is **not a corrected version of 62.134**. It is instead functionally identical to 62.137 (Pod) with one difference:

| Register | 62.134 Datamono | 62.137 Pod | 62.200 "Datamono Fixed" |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2306 APN | `data.mono` | `data641003` | `data641003` |
| 2308 carrier | absent | `Kore` | `Kore` |
| 2309 credential | absent | `Kore123` | `Kore123` |
| 2314 APN user | absent | `dummy` | `dummy` |
| 2315 APN pass | absent | `dummy` | `dummy` |
| 2319[0] primary | `52.164.241.179` | `52.164.241.179` | `52.164.241.179` |
| 2319[1] secondary | `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` | `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` | **absent** |
| 768[1] | `6704EB0F` | `6704EB0F` | `00000000` |
| 769[1] | `2AF8` | `2AF8` | `5014` |
| 1024[23] | `86` | `89` | `C8` |

The file labeled "Datamono Fixed" uses the Kore APN (`data641003`) and Kore credentials (`Kore123`), not the Monogoto/Data.Mono APN (`data.mono`) from 62.134. The "fix" appears to have changed the carrier configuration but retained the same shared credential. The secondary server (2319[1]) was **removed** in the Fixed version, and two radio/modem configuration registers differ. The name "Datamono Fixed" is misleading — this is effectively a Pod-carrier script without a secondary server fallback.

## Findings

**A31-1** — HIGH: Register 2309 contains plaintext shared credential "Kore123"
**Description:** Files 62.137 (`62.137 Rayven CI PAPE Final Pod.csv`) and 62.200 (`62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv`) both contain register 2309 with the decoded value `Kore123`. This is a known shared credential that appears in this repository across multiple scripts. Register 2309 is a credential-like field associated with the Kore carrier configuration (2308 = `Kore`). Storing this credential in plaintext in version-controlled configuration scripts means it is exposed to anyone with read access to the repository. If `Kore123` is an active network-access credential (e.g., for SIM provisioning, carrier portal, or device authentication with the Kore platform), its exposure could allow unauthorized provisioning or network access.
**Files affected:** `US Script/PAPE/62.137 Rayven CI PAPE Final Pod.csv` (line 1099), `US Script/PAPE/62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv` (line 1099)
**Fix:** Determine whether `Kore123` is an active credential. If so, rotate it immediately and replace the value in these scripts with a placeholder or reference to a secrets management system. If it is a default or non-sensitive device-side token, document that explicitly and assess whether it needs changing.

**A31-2** — MEDIUM: The "Datamono Fixed" label is misleading — 62.200 uses Kore/Pod carrier config, not Monogoto/Data.Mono
**Description:** File `62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv` is labeled as a fixed version of the Datamono script (62.134), but it does not use the `data.mono` APN. Instead it uses APN `data641003` with carrier `Kore` and credential `Kore123` — the same carrier configuration as the Pod script (62.137). This naming inconsistency creates operational risk: a technician deploying "Datamono Fixed" expecting it to configure devices for Monogoto SIMs will instead configure them for Kore SIMs. Devices with Monogoto SIMs would fail to connect; devices incorrectly provisioned with Kore settings on non-Kore SIMs would similarly fail. The mislabeling also obscures the fact that this file carries the Kore credential (2309 = `Kore123`).
**Files affected:** `US Script/PAPE/62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv`
**Fix:** Clarify the intent of this file. If it is meant to be a fixed Datamono script, update it to use APN `data.mono` and remove the Kore credential registers. If it is intentionally a Kore/Pod variant, rename it to remove the "Datamono" label to prevent misapplication.

---

**A31-3** — MEDIUM: Secondary server (2319[1]) removed in 62.200 without documentation
**Description:** Files 62.134 and 62.137 both configure a secondary server at `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` via register 2319[1]. File 62.200 ("Datamono Fixed") omits this secondary server entry entirely. Removal of the fallback server reduces connectivity resilience — if the primary IP `52.164.241.179` is unreachable, devices configured with 62.200 have no fallback. There is no comment or version note in the CSV explaining this removal. This is a silent functional regression introduced by the "fix."
**Files affected:** `US Script/PAPE/62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv`
**Fix:** Determine whether the removal of the secondary server was intentional. If intentional, document the rationale. If unintentional, restore 2319[1] with the appropriate secondary server hostname or IP for the target deployment.

---

**A31-4** — LOW: Primary server configured as bare IP address (52.164.241.179) without hostname validation
**Description:** All three files configure register 2319[0] with the raw IP address `52.164.241.179`. Using a bare IP address rather than a hostname means the device cannot perform hostname-based certificate validation (SNI/TLS), making it harder to detect if the server changes or if a device is redirected to a rogue IP. The secondary server in 62.134 and 62.137 correctly uses a hostname (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`). The mixed approach — IP for primary, hostname for secondary — is inconsistent. Additionally, if the Azure or cloud IP `52.164.241.179` is reassigned or changes, all devices using this IP will lose connectivity with no DNS-based recovery.
**Files affected:** All three files (62.134, 62.137, 62.200)
**Fix:** Replace the primary server IP with its corresponding FQDN if one exists. This improves TLS certificate validation, supports DNS-based failover, and reduces the impact of IP address changes.

---

**A31-5** — INFO: APN credentials use placeholder value "dummy"
**Description:** Registers 2314 (APN username) and 2315 (APN password) in files 62.137 and 62.200 are set to the value `dummy`. This appears to be the expected behavior for Kore SIM deployments where the carrier does not require APN authentication credentials. The placeholder is consistent and clearly non-sensitive. No real credentials are exposed.
**Files affected:** `US Script/PAPE/62.137 Rayven CI PAPE Final Pod.csv`, `US Script/PAPE/62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv`
**Fix:** No immediate action required. Confirm with the carrier that unauthenticated APN access is the intended configuration. If APN-level authentication is later required, ensure real credentials are handled via a secrets management process rather than being committed in plaintext.

---

**A31-6** — INFO: Register 3331 value "*****" present in all three files
**Description:** Register 3331[0] in all three files decodes to `*****` (five asterisk characters, hex `2A2A2A2A2A00`). The purpose of register 3331 is not fully documented in available reference material. The asterisk pattern may represent a masked or default value. It does not appear to contain a real credential in decoded form, but cannot be conclusively classified without register documentation.
**Files affected:** All three files
**Fix:** Obtain vendor documentation for register 3331 to confirm its purpose and acceptable values. If it represents a masked credential field, assess whether the underlying value is sensitive and whether it is appropriately protected.

Checklist item 1 (Plaintext credentials in repo): Finding A31-1 raised — register 2309 contains `Kore123` in 62.137 and 62.200.

Checklist item 2 (APN credential exposure): Registers 2314/2315 contain `dummy` placeholder values only — no real APN credentials exposed. See A31-5 (INFO).

Checklist item 3 (Server endpoint exposure): Server endpoints confirmed present and decoded. Primary IP hardcoded; secondary hostname present in 62.134 and 62.137 but absent in 62.200. See A31-4 (LOW) and A31-3 (MEDIUM).

Checklist item 4 (Credential reuse across files): Register 2309 value `Kore123` is identical in 62.137 and 62.200. This is consistent with a shared carrier credential rather than per-device credentials. Already captured in A31-1.

Checklist item 5 (Naming/labeling accuracy): File 62.200 is mislabeled as "Datamono Fixed" while containing Kore/Pod carrier configuration. See A31-2 (MEDIUM).

Checklist item 6 (Silent functional regression): Secondary server removed in 62.200 without documentation. See A31-3 (MEDIUM).
