## Reading Evidence

### FILE: UK Script/161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv

**Row count:** 1235 data rows (plus 1 header row)

**All decoded server endpoints (IPs, hostnames, ports):**
- Register 2311,0 (port): hex `5014` = 20500 decimal
- Register 2319,0 (primary server): hex `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` = `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`
- Register 2320,0 (secondary server): hex `646D2E63616C616D702E636F2E756B00` = `dm.calamp.co.uk`

**All decoded APN names:**
- Register 2306,0: hex `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` = `data.mono`
- Register 2306,1: hex `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` = `data.mono`

**APN username (decoded):**
- Register 2314: NOT PRESENT in file (blank — no entry)

**APN password (decoded):**
- Register 2315: NOT PRESENT in file (blank — no entry)

**Register 2309 value (decoded):**
- NOT PRESENT in file

**Register 3331 value (decoded):**
- Register 3331,0: hex `2A2A2A2A2A00` = `*****` (five asterisks — masked/obfuscated value committed to repo)

**Other credential-like values:**
- Register 2178,0: hex `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` = `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` (non-printable/control characters; not a plaintext credential)
- No register 2308, 2307 value present (2307,0 = `00`, empty)

**Differences from Aus Script files:**
- APN: `data.mono` — this is a UK-specific carrier APN (Mono Wireless / MonoMobile UK), distinct from Australian carrier APNs (e.g., Kore, Telstra). No APN username or password present, consistent with Mono's SIM-based authentication.
- Primary server: `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` — a UK/European tracking platform hostname, not seen in Australian scripts.
- Secondary server: `dm.calamp.co.uk` — a CalAmp UK device management endpoint; the `.co.uk` domain confirms UK deployment.
- Register 2309 absent (Aus scripts contained `Kore123` credential in this register).

### FILE: UK Script/161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv

**Row count:** 1235 data rows (plus 1 header row)

**All decoded server endpoints (IPs, hostnames, ports):**
- Register 2311,0 (port): hex `5014` = 20500 decimal
- Register 2319,0 (primary server): hex `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` = `52.164.241.179` (raw IPv4 address)
- Register 2320,0 (secondary server): hex `646D2E63616C616D702E636F2E756B00` = `dm.calamp.co.uk`

**All decoded APN names:**
- Register 2306,0: hex `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` = `data.mono`
- Register 2306,1: hex `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` = `data.mono`

**APN username (decoded):**
- Register 2314: NOT PRESENT in file (blank — no entry)

**APN password (decoded):**
- Register 2315: NOT PRESENT in file (blank — no entry)

**Register 2309 value (decoded):**
- NOT PRESENT in file

**Register 3331 value (decoded):**
- Register 3331,0: hex `2A2A2A2A2A00` = `*****` (five asterisks — masked/obfuscated value committed to repo)

**Other credential-like values:**
- Register 2178,0: hex `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` = `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` (non-printable/control characters; not a plaintext credential)
- No register 2308 or 2309 present.

**Differences from Aus Script files:**
- APN: same UK `data.mono` as 161.31.
- Primary server: `52.164.241.179` — a raw IP address instead of a hostname. This is a Microsoft Azure IP in the West Europe region (confirmed by the `52.164.x.x` allocation range). This is notably different from the hostname-based primary server used in 161.31 (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`), suggesting 161.32 points to a Rayven Demo platform server directly by IP.
- Secondary server: same `dm.calamp.co.uk` as 161.31.
- Register 2309 absent (no credential-like field present, unlike some Aus scripts).
- File is labelled "Rayven Demo" — a demo/development configuration, which may account for the raw IP endpoint rather than a production hostname.

## Findings

**A25-1** — MEDIUM: Production server hostname committed to git in plaintext (161.31)

**Description:** Register 2319,0 in `161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv` contains the primary server hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` encoded as a null-terminated hex byte string in a file committed to the git repository. While hex-encoded, this is trivially decoded and constitutes a server endpoint disclosure in version control history. An attacker with read access to the repository can identify the live tracking platform host and target it for reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts against the fleet management infrastructure.

**Fix:** Remove server endpoint values from committed configuration files. Store infrastructure hostnames in a secrets manager or environment-specific deployment pipeline variable. If the files must remain in version control, replace actual server values with documented placeholder tokens (e.g., `<PRIMARY_SERVER>`) and inject real values at deployment time. Additionally, rotate or review any access controls on `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` given the disclosure.

---

**A25-2** — HIGH: Raw production IPv4 address committed to git (161.32)

**Description:** Register 2319,0 in `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` contains the raw IPv4 address `52.164.241.179` as the primary server endpoint, committed in version control. A raw IP address in a device configuration script is a more severe disclosure than a hostname because: (1) it bypasses DNS-level controls and filtering; (2) it directly identifies the hosting provider and region (Microsoft Azure West Europe); (3) it exposes the exact network target without any indirection; and (4) if the IP is reassigned or changes, devices may connect to an unintended host. Even if this is labelled a "Demo" script, the IP may point to a live or shared infrastructure server.

**Fix:** Replace the raw IP address with a managed hostname (FQDN) that resolves via DNS, so the underlying IP can be rotated without requiring a firmware/configuration update. Remove the raw IP from version control history using `git filter-repo` or equivalent. Verify whether `52.164.241.179` is a dedicated demo server or shared with production, and apply appropriate network access controls.

**A25-3** — MEDIUM: UK carrier APN name committed to git across both files

**Description:** Register 2306 in both files contains the APN string `data.mono` in plaintext (hex-encoded) committed to version control. This is the APN for Mono Wireless (MonoMobile), a UK IoT SIM provider. While `data.mono` is a semi-public APN and no credentials (2314/2315) are present — suggesting Mono uses SIM-based authentication — committing carrier-specific APN values to a public or shared repository reveals which carrier is used for the UK fleet deployment. This could assist an attacker targeting the mobile network or attempting SIM-swap or carrier-level attacks.

**Fix:** Move APN configuration values to deployment-time injection rather than committing them to source control. If the repository is internal-only with appropriate access controls, document the risk as accepted. Confirm with Mono whether additional APN authentication (username/password) should be configured for defence-in-depth.

**A25-4** — MEDIUM: Register 3331 contains masked value `*****` committed to git (both files)

**Description:** Register 3331,0 in both files decodes to `*****` (five ASCII asterisks, hex `2A2A2A2A2A00`). This pattern strongly suggests the field previously held a real secret or credential that was masked before committing — a common but insufficient practice. The masking with asterisks means: (1) the field is clearly intended to hold a sensitive value; (2) the actual value is unknown from the file alone but the placeholder was committed, making it unclear whether devices configured from this script will have the field blank, set to literal asterisks, or require a separate out-of-band injection; and (3) if literal asterisks are pushed to devices, this may represent an authentication bypass or misconfiguration. The purpose of register 3331 is not formally documented in available CalAmp references reviewed during this audit, increasing the risk.

**Fix:** Determine the authoritative purpose of register 3331 in the CalAmp LMU parameter set. If it holds a credential or authentication token: (a) ensure devices are not provisioned with literal `*****`; (b) inject the real value at deployment time from a secrets manager; (c) do not commit even masked representations to version control. If the field is non-sensitive (e.g., a display string), document that determination in the repository.

**A25-5** — INFO: Secondary server `dm.calamp.co.uk` committed to git (both files)

**Description:** Register 2320,0 in both files decodes to `dm.calamp.co.uk`, the CalAmp UK device management endpoint. This is a vendor-standard endpoint and its presence is expected in CalAmp LMU configurations for UK deployments. It is noted for completeness as it constitutes an infrastructure endpoint disclosure in version control.

**Fix:** No immediate remediation required beyond the general recommendation (A25-1/A25-2) to avoid committing server endpoints to version control. Ensure network access controls on `dm.calamp.co.uk` are managed by CalAmp and that device authentication to this endpoint is certificate or token-based.

**A25-6** — INFO: Demo configuration (`161.32`) uses different primary server than CI configuration (`161.31`)

**Description:** The two files in this pair serve different purposes: 161.31 is a "CI only" (production-like) configuration pointing to `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`, while 161.32 is a "Rayven Demo" configuration pointing to raw IP `52.164.241.179`. The divergence in primary endpoints means devices using the demo script will report to a different server than production devices. If demo-configured devices are inadvertently deployed to production, tracking data may be silently routed to the demo server instead of the production platform. This also suggests a risk that demo scripts may be applied to real devices.

**Fix:** Add clear labelling or a configuration guard in the deployment process to prevent demo scripts from being applied to production hardware. Consider separate access-controlled repositories or directories for demo vs. production scripts. Review whether `52.164.241.179` is a production Azure VM, a shared demo environment, or a temporary resource.
