## Reading Evidence

---

FILE: C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/.gitignore
Type: Git ignore rules file
Sections/entries:
- Comment header (lines 1–4): boilerplate Atlassian template notice
- Node artifact files: `node_modules/`, `dist/`
- Compiled Java class files: `*.class`
- Compiled Python bytecode: `*.py[cod]`
- Log files: `*.log`
- Package files: `*.jar`
- Maven: `target/`, `dist/` (duplicate entry)
- JetBrains IDE: `.idea/`
- Unit test reports: `TEST*.xml`
- Generated by MacOS: `.DS_Store`
- Generated by Windows: `Thumbs.db`
- Applications: `*.app`, `*.exe`, `*.war`
- Large media files: `*.mp4`, `*.tiff`, `*.avi`, `*.flv`, `*.mov`, `*.wmv`

Credentials or sensitive values found: none
URLs/IPs/ports found: none (only an Atlassian documentation URL in a comment)

Notable absences (relevant to actual repo content):
- No rule for `*.csv` (device configuration scripts — the primary repo content)
- No rule for `*.xlsx` (a file named "URL & PORTS.xlsx" is currently tracked)
- No rule for `*.zip` (a file named "LMUMgr_8.9.10.7.zip" is currently tracked)
- No rule for `*.xml` (LMU Toolbox XML config files are tracked)
- No rule for `*.bin` (a binary file `x.bin` is currently tracked)
- No rules addressing environment files (`.env`, `*.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.pfx`)
- No rules addressing credential or secret files (`secrets.*`, `credentials.*`)

FILE: C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/README.md
Type: Markdown README
Sections/entries:
- Section "What is this repository for?": describes repo purpose (CalAmp scripts for Rayven CI transfer, divided by country and SIM type)
- Section "How do I get set up?": instructs users to obtain "CALAMP APPS" folder locally, extract LMU Manager from it or download from CalAmp developer portal; notes all scripts are CSV files; instructs on creating new scripts
- Section "Who do I talk to?": names a single contact — "Rhythm Duwadi" — for new scripts or changes

Credentials or sensitive values found: none
URLs/IPs/ports found: none
Personal names found: "Rhythm Duwadi" (contact person)

## Findings

### .gitignore

**A01-1** — MEDIUM: .gitignore does not exclude the primary sensitive file types present in this repository

**Description:** The .gitignore file is an unmodified boilerplate Atlassian template targeting Node.js, Java, Python, and JetBrains IDE artifacts. It contains no rules relevant to the actual content of this repository. As a direct consequence, the following sensitive or large binary file types are currently tracked and committed to the repository:

- `URL & PORTS.xlsx` — an Excel spreadsheet whose filename explicitly states it contains server URLs and ports. This file is committed and visible to anyone with repository access.
- `CALAMP APPS/LMUMgr_8.9.10.7.zip` — a 3rd-party vendor application archive (~binary) committed to the repository. Binary files in version control bloat repository size, cannot be meaningfully diffed, and may contain embedded licensing or proprietary data.
- `CALAMP APPS/AppendCRC16ToBin/x.bin` — a raw binary file committed to the repository with no documented purpose.
- `CALAMP APPS/LMUToolbox_V41/*.xml` — XML toolbox configuration files that may contain device-specific parameters.
- All `*.csv` device configuration scripts — while these are the intentional content of the repo, if any future script inadvertently contains APN credentials or authentication tokens, the absence of a review-oriented ignore pattern means there is no structural protection.

There are also no ignore rules for common secret-bearing file types (`.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.pfx`, `secrets.*`, `credentials.*`), meaning a developer who accidentally creates such a file locally would have no automatic protection from committing it.

**Fix:**
1. Add ignore rules for file types that should never be committed: `.env`, `*.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.pfx`, `secrets.*`, `credentials.*`.
2. Evaluate whether `URL & PORTS.xlsx`, `LMUMgr_8.9.10.7.zip`, and `x.bin` should remain tracked. If the Excel file contains server addresses and ports (which its name implies), consider whether that information constitutes sensitive network topology data. If so, remove it from tracking with `git rm --cached` and add `*.xlsx` to .gitignore. Binary application files (`.zip`, `.bin`) should be distributed via an artifact repository or documented download link rather than committed to source control.
3. Replace the boilerplate .gitignore with one tailored to this repository's actual content.

**A01-2** — LOW: Duplicate `dist/` entry in .gitignore

**Description:** The path `dist/` appears twice in .gitignore (line 8 under "Node artifact files" and line 24 under "Maven"). This is a minor issue indicating the file has not been reviewed or maintained since its initial template creation.

**Fix:** Remove the duplicate entry. More broadly, replace the entire boilerplate file with one written specifically for this repository's actual technology stack (CSV, XML, XLSX, ZIP).

---

### README.md

**A01-3** — LOW: README names a single individual as the sole point of contact without a role, team, or fallback

**Description:** The "Who do I talk to?" section names one person ("Rhythm Duwadi") as the only contact for all changes to device configuration scripts. This creates a bus-factor risk and means the repository has no documented escalation path, team ownership, or alternative contact. It also exposes a personal name in a repository that may be accessible to a broad audience.

**Fix:** Replace or supplement the individual name with a team name, role title, or shared communication channel (e.g., a team email address or Jira project link). If individual names are retained, confirm that publishing them in this repository is acceptable under the organisation's privacy and access-control policies.

---

**A01-4** — INFO: README references a local folder ("CALAMP APPS") and an external vendor portal without access controls documented

**Description:** The setup instructions direct users to "Get the folder 'CALAMP APPS' to your local" and to "get the latest version from CALAMP developer portal." The CALAMP APPS folder (containing a .zip, .bin, and .xml files) is committed directly to the repository rather than obtained from the vendor portal. This means the repository is being used as a file distribution mechanism for vendor tooling. There are no documented access control requirements (e.g., who is permitted to clone this repository), nor any statement of whether the committed vendor application files are licensed for redistribution.

**Fix:** Document the licensing status of the committed CalAmp application files. If redistribution is not permitted under the CalAmp developer agreement, remove the files from the repository and replace the setup instructions with a link to the official vendor download. Clarify the intended audience and access level for this repository.

### Checklist Items With No Issues

Checklist item 2 (AWS credentials): No issues found. No AWS access keys, S3 bucket names, SQS URLs, or account IDs were identified in .gitignore or README.md.

Checklist item 3 (Inbound device data): Not applicable to configuration files.

Checklist item 5 (Error handling): Not applicable to configuration files.

Checklist item 7 (Server/deployment — credentials in README): No credentials, passwords, API keys, or authentication tokens were found in README.md. The README contains no hardcoded server addresses or ports (those appear to reside in the committed .xlsx and .csv files, which are outside the scope of this agent's assigned files).
