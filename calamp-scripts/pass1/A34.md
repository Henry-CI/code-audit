### FILE: `US Script/PAPE/63.137 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv`

**Row count:** 1237 data rows (plus 1 header row = 1238 lines total)

**All decoded server endpoints (IPs, hostnames, ports):**
- Register 2319,0: `52.164.241.179` (primary server IP) — identical to 62.371
- No register 2311 present
- No register 2320 present

**All decoded APN names:**
- Register 2306,0: `data641003`
- Register 2306,1: `data641003`

**APN username (decoded):**
- Register 2314,0: `dummy`

**What distinguishes 63.137 from 62.371 (version increment):**
A `diff` of the two files reveals exactly one line difference:

| Parameter | 62.371 value | 63.137 value |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1024,1    | `3E` (62 decimal) | `3F` (63 decimal) |

Register 1024 appears to be a firmware/script version register. The single-byte increment from `0x3E` (62) to `0x3F` (63) corresponds exactly to the script version number change in the filename (62.x to 63.x). All security-relevant registers — credentials, APN, server endpoint, 3331 — are byte-for-byte identical between the two files. There are no substantive security differences.

### FILE: `US Script/PAPE/69.007 Final POD SIMcard.csv`

**Row count:** 1241 data rows (plus 1 header row = 1242 lines total; 4 additional rows vs 62.371/63.137)

**All decoded server endpoints (IPs, hostnames, ports):**

- Register 2306,1: `data641003`

**APN username (decoded):**
- Register 2314,0: `dummy`
- Register 2314,1: `dummy`

- Register 2310,0: `00000000` (zero/null value)

**What distinguishes 69.007 from the 62.x/63.x files:**
A `diff` of 69.007 against 62.371 reveals four additional rows and two changed rows:

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| 1024,1 changed | `0x3E` → `0x45` (69 decimal; matches filename version 69.x) |
| 1024,23 changed | `0x89` → `0x07` (different internal firmware/modem config byte) |
| 2310,0 added | `00000000` (new register present, value zero) |
| 2311,0 added | `0x5014` = port 20500 (explicit server port now set) |
| 2320,0 added | `dm.calamp.com` (secondary/fallback server hostname now set) |
| 2322,0 added | `0x00015180` = 86400 (likely interval parameter) |

The 69.007 file is a POD SIM card-specific final version that adds explicit secondary server routing (`dm.calamp.com`) and an explicit port assignment (20500), which were absent from the 62.x/63.x Pod Fixed scripts. All credential registers remain unchanged across all three files.

## Findings

**A34-1** — HIGH: Hardcoded plaintext credential in register 2309 across all three files

**Description:** Register 2309,0 contains the value `Kore123` in all three files (62.371, 63.137, 69.007). This is a known, shared, hardcoded credential — likely an MVNO (Kore Wireless) authentication credential or network access credential — stored in plaintext in a version-controlled configuration file. The value `Kore123` has been observed across multiple PAPE scripts in this repository, confirming it is a fleet-wide shared secret embedded in source control. Anyone with read access to this repository can extract the credential directly. The credential appears in a field (2309) described as "credential-like" in the audit specification and is confirmed to decode to a human-readable password-format string with mixed case and a numeric suffix.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files; rows 1099 in 62.371 and 63.137, row 1099 in 69.007.

**Fix:** Remove the credential value from all CSV configuration scripts stored in version control. Replace with a per-device provisioning token retrieved at device activation time, or use a credential injection mechanism that does not require the secret to appear in source-controlled files. If the credential cannot be removed from the device configuration format, restrict repository access to personnel with an operational need and rotate the credential immediately. Audit all devices already provisioned with this credential for unauthorized use.

---

**A34-2** — HIGH: Primary server IP address hardcoded as a raw IPv4 address with no hostname validation

**Description:** Register 2319,0 decodes to the IPv4 address `52.164.241.179` in all three files. Using a raw IP address rather than a hostname bypasses any DNS-based revocation or redirection capability. If this IP address changes (cloud provider reassigns it, infrastructure is migrated, or the server is decommissioned), all provisioned devices will silently lose connectivity with no graceful fallback. More critically, if the IP is ever acquired by a malicious party following infrastructure changes, devices will continue to report to it. There is no indication of certificate pinning or mutual TLS that would mitigate server impersonation at this IP.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files; row 1109 in 62.371 and 63.137, row 1111 in 69.007.

**Fix:** Replace the raw IP address in register 2319 with a stable, organization-controlled FQDN (fully qualified domain name). This enables certificate validation, DNS-based revocation, and controlled failover. If a static IP is operationally required, document the justification and ensure certificate pinning or mutual TLS is in place to prevent impersonation.

**A34-3** — MEDIUM: Secondary server `dm.calamp.com` present only in 69.007, absent from 62.371 and 63.137

**Description:** Register 2320,0 in 69.007 sets a secondary/fallback server of `dm.calamp.com`. This hostname is not present in the 62.371 or 63.137 Pod Fixed scripts. This inconsistency means that devices provisioned with the 62.371/63.137 scripts have no secondary server configured (register 2320 is entirely absent from those files), while 69.007 devices have a CalAmp-branded fallback. The absence of a secondary server in the 62.x/63.x scripts creates a single point of failure for server connectivity. Additionally, `dm.calamp.com` appears to be a CalAmp device management domain; its presence as a secondary server in only one variant of what is nominally the same deployment script is an inconsistency that warrants review to confirm it is intentional.

**Files affected:** 62.371 and 63.137 (missing 2320); 69.007 (present).

**Fix:** Determine whether all three script variants should have a secondary server configured. If so, add register 2320 with the appropriate secondary hostname to 62.371 and 63.137. If 69.007 is the definitive final version and supersedes the others, document that 62.371 and 63.137 are deprecated and should not be deployed further.

---

**A34-4** — MEDIUM: Server port 20500 (register 2311) explicitly set only in 69.007; absent from 62.371 and 63.137

**Description:** Register 2311,0 (`0x5014` = 20500 decimal) is present only in 69.007. The 62.371 and 63.137 scripts do not set this register at all, meaning devices provisioned from those scripts rely on a device default port value rather than an explicitly configured one. Port 20500 is a non-standard port. The inconsistency between script variants — one explicitly setting the port, others omitting it — is a configuration hygiene issue that could result in connectivity failures if device firmware defaults differ from the intended port, or if a firmware update changes the default.

**Files affected:** 62.371 and 63.137 (register 2311 absent); 69.007 (register 2311 = 20500).

**Fix:** Explicitly set register 2311 in all script variants intended for the same deployment target to ensure consistent, predictable port configuration regardless of device firmware defaults. Confirm that port 20500 is the correct intended value for the 62.x/63.x scripts and add the register accordingly, or document why the omission is intentional.

**A34-5** — LOW: APN credentials use the literal string "dummy" rather than being blank or device-specific

**Description:** Registers 2314 (APN username) and 2315 (APN password) both decode to `dummy` in all three files, across both provisioning indices (index 0 and index 1). While "dummy" is preferable to a real credential appearing in source control, the use of the literal string `dummy` is ambiguous: it is unclear whether the carrier (Kore Wireless, per register 2308) accepts any arbitrary username/password for this APN or whether `dummy` is a recognized placeholder that was intentional. If the carrier at any point requires non-null credentials matching a specific value, a dummy placeholder will silently fail authentication. The value should be documented as intentionally placeholder.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files.

**Fix:** Document explicitly in a comment or accompanying configuration management record that `dummy` is the correct and accepted APN credential for the Kore `data641003` APN. If the carrier ever requires real credentials, replace `dummy` with the actual values using a secure credential injection process rather than committing them to source control.

---

**A34-6** — LOW: Register 3331 stores a masked value `*****` of unknown semantic meaning

**Description:** Register 3331,0 decodes to `*****` (five asterisk characters) in all three files. The audit specification notes this register as "Unknown (seen as '*****' in other files)." The asterisk pattern is consistent with a masked/redacted credential or sensitive value that has been replaced with asterisks, either as a display artifact or as a deliberate scrubbing. It is not possible from the script alone to determine whether this represents a real value that was masked for storage (which would be a security concern) or whether `*****` is the actual configured value the device will use. If it represents a masked real credential, the device may be configured with a value that differs from what is documented.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files; row 1235 in 62.371/63.137, row 1239 in 69.007.

**Fix:** Identify and document what register 3331 controls in the CalAmp LMU firmware. Determine whether `*****` is a valid device configuration value or a placeholder masking a real credential. If it masks a real credential, this register should be treated as a credential register and the actual value should not be stored in version-controlled source files.

**A34-7** — INFO: 62.371 and 63.137 are functionally identical except for a single version byte increment

**Description:** A byte-level diff of 62.371 and 63.137 shows exactly one difference: register 1024,1 changes from `0x3E` (62 decimal) to `0x3F` (63 decimal), corresponding to the script version number encoded in the filename. All security-relevant registers — 2306, 2308, 2309, 2314, 2315, 2316, 2318, 2319, 3331 — are byte-for-byte identical. The 63.137 file is a minor version bump of 62.371 with no security-relevant changes.

**Files affected:** 62.371 and 63.137.

**Fix:** No security remediation required. As an operational note, maintaining two nearly identical files in version control without a changelog comment creates confusion about which is authoritative. Consider adding a comment field or accompanying documentation identifying 63.137 as the successor to 62.371 and deprecating 62.371 if it is no longer in active use.

---

**A34-8** — INFO: All three files use the same primary server IP and Kore MVNO configuration

**Description:** All three files provision devices onto the same carrier (Kore Wireless, APN `data641003`) pointing to the same primary server IP (`52.164.241.179`). This confirms these are variants of the same deployment configuration rather than configurations for distinct customer environments. The security posture is consistent across all three files for the shared parameters.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files.

**Fix:** No action required. Noted for cross-file consistency context.
