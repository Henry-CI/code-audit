## Findings

---

**A09-1** — HIGH: Plaintext credential `Kore123` committed in register 2309 across all three files

**Description:** Register 2309 in all three files decodes to the string `Kore123` (hex `4B6F726531323300`). The audit brief explicitly flags this exact value as HIGH severity. This is a credential-like string associated with the Kore wireless network operator (register 2308 = `Kore`). The value is stored in plaintext in version-controlled CSV files and is present in:
- `61.141 Rayven and CI clone CEA data Mono Final.csv` — row 1099: `2309,0,4B6F726531323300`
- `69.003 RD CEA Telstra Final.csv` — row 1097: `2309,0,4B6F726531323300`
- `69.004 RD CEA Monogoto Final.csv` — row 1099: `2309,0,4B6F726531323300`

The string `Kore123` matches a known default or shared credential pattern. Its presence in a public or shared git repository means it is permanently exposed in git history even if removed from the current HEAD.

**Fix:** Rotate or invalidate the `Kore123` credential with the Kore network operator immediately. Confirm with Kore whether 2309 is used as an authentication token, SIM group code, or operator access key, and apply the appropriate access revocation. Remove the value from these files and replace with a placeholder (e.g., empty or a non-functional stub). Purge the value from git history using `git filter-repo` or BFG Repo Cleaner, or treat the repository as permanently compromised with respect to this credential.

---

**A09-2** — HIGH: Production server hostname committed in plaintext in `61.141 Rayven and CI clone CEA data Mono Final.csv`

**Description:** Register 2319,0 in `61.141 Rayven and CI clone CEA data Mono Final.csv` (row 1103) decodes to `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`. This is a production GPS tracking server hostname committed directly to the repository. Exposure of this hostname enables adversaries to target the server directly (reconnaissance, denial-of-service, connection spoofing attempts). The secondary entry at 2319,1 (row 1104) further exposes the IP address `52.164.241.179`, which resolves the same server.

**Fix:** Accept that hostnames in device configuration scripts are operationally necessary and difficult to fully conceal, but assess whether this repository has appropriate access controls. If the repository is or could become public, ensure the server at `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` / `52.164.241.179` has firewall rules that restrict inbound connections to known device IP ranges only, and is not relying on obscurity for security. Document this as an accepted exposure if the server is already hardened.

---

**A09-3** — MEDIUM: Production server IP address `52.164.241.179` committed in plaintext in all three files

**Description:** Register 2319,0 in `69.003 RD CEA Telstra Final.csv` (row 1101) and `69.004 RD CEA Monogoto Final.csv` (row 1103) decodes to `52.164.241.179`. The same IP also appears as 2319,1 in `61.141 Rayven and CI clone CEA data Mono Final.csv` (row 1104). This is a hardcoded production server IP address in all three files. IP-based configuration is less flexible than hostname-based (no DNS failover) and the specific IP is permanently recorded in git history.

**Fix:** Prefer hostname-based server configuration (2319 = hostname) over direct IP addresses to allow server migration without device re-programming. Ensure the server at this IP is protected by firewall ingress rules. Treat the IP as permanently disclosed in git history.

---

**A09-4** — MEDIUM: Register 3331 contains asterisk-masked value in all three files

**Description:** Register 3331,0 in all three files decodes to `*****` (five ASCII asterisk characters, hex `2A2A2A2A2A00`). The asterisk pattern is consistent with a UI-masked credential or PIN that has been serialised to the device configuration file as its masked representation rather than cleared or omitted. If a device configuration tool exported a live password field as `*****`, the actual credential may have been lost and the device may be configured with the literal string `*****` as its value, or this field was intentionally left as a placeholder. Either case is a concern: the former means a non-functional configuration, the latter means a weak/default-like value.

**Fix:** Determine what register 3331 controls. If it is a PIN, password, or access token field, establish whether the literal value `*****` is being provisioned to devices or whether this is a display artifact from a configuration tool. If devices are receiving `*****` as an actual credential, this is a default-equivalent credential. Clear or correctly populate this field.

---

**A09-5** — LOW: APN name `data.mono` (Monogoto) committed in plaintext

**Description:** Register 2306 in `61.141 Rayven and CI clone CEA data Mono Final.csv` and `69.004 RD CEA Monogoto Final.csv` decodes to `data.mono`, the public APN for the Monogoto IoT network operator. This is a well-known public APN value, not a secret. Its presence in a git repository is low risk but does confirm which carrier is in use, which may have minor operational security implications.

**Fix:** No immediate action required. This is a standard public APN name. Ensure the repository access controls are appropriate to limit unnecessary disclosure of the carrier relationship.

---

**A09-6** — INFO: APN credentials (registers 2314, 2315) absent in all three files

The APN username (2314) and APN password (2315) registers are not present in any of the three files. The Monogoto `data.mono` APN and Kore configurations represented here do not appear to require username/password APN authentication (consistent with IoT SIM-based authentication where credentials are embedded in the SIM rather than the APN settings).

Checklist item 1 (APN username/password in plaintext): No issues found — registers 2314 and 2315 absent.

---

**A09-7** — INFO: Register 2320 (secondary server) absent in all three files

Checklist item 2 (secondary server endpoint): Register 2320 is not present in any of the three files. No secondary server hostname or IP is configured via this register. (Note: `61.141` does configure a secondary endpoint via 2319,1 = `52.164.241.179`, covered in A09-2 and A09-3.)

---

**A09-8** — INFO: Register 2178 contains device message template tag string

Register 2178,0 in all three files decodes to `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`. This appears to be a device-side message formatting template using angle-bracket tag tokens. It is not a credential or server endpoint. No security issue identified.

Checklist item 3 (register 2178 credential-like content): No issues found.
