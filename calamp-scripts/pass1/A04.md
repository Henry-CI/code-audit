## Reading Evidence

### FILE: Aus Script/61.61 General for CI old dashboard datamono.csv

**Format and row count:** Standard 3-column CSV (`parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`). 1232 rows including header (1231 data rows).

**Column headers:** `parameter_id`, `parameter_index`, `parameter_value`

**All server endpoints (decoded):**
- Register 2319 (primary server hostname), index 0:

  - Decoded: `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`
- Register 2312 (server port), index 0:
  - Raw hex: `0011`
  - Decoded: port **17** (decimal)
- Register 2320 (secondary server): NOT PRESENT in this file.
- Register 2311 (alternate port register): NOT PRESENT in this file.

**All APN names (decoded):**
- Register 2306 (APN name), index 0:
  - Raw hex: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00`
  - Decoded: `data.mono`
- Register 2306 (APN name), index 1:
  - Raw hex: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00`
  - Decoded: `data.mono` (same value, both indices)

**APN username (decoded):**
- Register 2314 (APN username): NOT PRESENT in this file. No username is configured.

**APN password (decoded):**
- Register 2315 (APN password): NOT PRESENT in this file. No password is configured.

**Other credential-like values:**
- Register 2308, index 0:
  - Raw hex: `4B6F726500`
  - Decoded: `Kore` — Kore Wireless, an MVNO operator name field.
- Register 2309, index 0:
  - Raw hex: `4B6F726531323300`
  - Decoded: `Kore123` — A non-trivial string in a register adjacent to the operator name field. Visually resembles a password or PIN (operator name + numeric suffix). This warrants attention regardless of whether the register is formally a credential field.
- Register 2318, index 0:
  - Raw hex: `2A323238393900`
  - Decoded: `*22899` — An SMS shortcode or USSD string used for CalAmp device provisioning/activation. Not a password but is an operational detail.

- Register 3331, index 0:
  - Raw hex: `2A2A2A2A2A00`
  - Decoded: `*****` — Five asterisks. Could be a masked/placeholder field or a literal value for an SMS filter/pattern. Not clearly a credential.

**Notable differences from other assigned file:**
- This file includes register 2306 (APN = `data.mono`); the other file does not.
- This file uses a **hostname** for the primary server (register 2319): `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`.
- Device-specific seed/ID registers differ (768,0 = `6704EB0F`; 769,0 = `2AF8`).

## Security Review

### Checklist Item 1 — Secrets/Credentials

**A04-1** — MEDIUM: Credential-like value `Kore123` committed in register 2309 of both files

**Description:** Register 2309 in both files decodes to `Kore123`. Register 2308 in both files decodes to `Kore` (the Kore Wireless MVNO name). The value `Kore123` has the structure of a password or PIN — an operator name followed by a numeric suffix — and appears in a register adjacent to the operator name field. If register 2309 is a SIM/operator authentication field (e.g., a network access password or SIM PIN), this is a credential committed to version control. Even if this register is benign (e.g., a display label), the value pattern warrants confirmation. Both files are affected identically.
- File 1, line 1099: `2309,0,4B6F726531323300` → `Kore123`
- File 2, line 1097: `2309,0,4B6F726531323300` → `Kore123`

**Fix:** Confirm the purpose of register 2309 against CalAmp LMU documentation. If it is any form of authentication credential (SIM PIN, operator password, network key), rotate the credential immediately and replace the committed value with a placeholder or remove the register from the script. If it is confirmed to be a non-secret label field, annotate this in a repository comment and close the finding.

---

**A04-2** — LOW: Register 3331 contains the value `*****` (five asterisks) in both files

**Description:** Register 3331 decodes to `*****` in both files. This pattern is commonly used to represent a masked or placeholder credential (e.g., a pre-shared key stored as asterisks). It may be a literal SMS filter pattern rather than a masked secret, but the value is ambiguous without documentation.
- File 1, line 1229: `3331,0,2A2A2A2A2A00`
- File 2, line 1227: `3331,0,2A2A2A2A2A00`

**Fix:** Confirm register 3331's purpose against CalAmp documentation. If it stores any form of shared secret or password, the actual value must not be committed (even masked), and the field's security impact should be documented. If it is a literal SMS pattern (e.g., a wildcard), document this to remove ambiguity.

---

**A04-3** — INFO: APN credential registers (2314, 2315) absent from both files

**Description:** Neither file contains register 2314 (APN username) or 2315 (APN password). This means no explicit APN credentials are programmed by these scripts. The APN name `data.mono` in File 1 is consistent with an open/unauthenticated APN used by some Australian MVNOs. The absence of 2314/2315 reduces credential exposure but also means the device relies on whatever credentials are already stored on the device or defaults to the SIM's provisioned APN settings.

**Fix:** No immediate action required. Confirm by design that the target APN (`data.mono`) does not require username/password authentication. If credentials are required, they should be provisioned through a secure out-of-band mechanism rather than committed to this repository.

---

### Checklist Item 2 — Infrastructure Exposure

**A04-4** — MEDIUM: Primary server hostname committed to version control in File 1

**Description:** File 1 (line 1103) contains register 2319 (primary server hostname) decoded as `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`. This fully qualified domain name is committed in plain text (hex-encoded but trivially decoded) to a git repository. Anyone with repository access can identify the GPS tracking platform's ingestion endpoint. If this hostname resolves to a shared or customer-specific platform, its disclosure could assist an attacker in targeting the server, crafting spoofed device traffic, or performing reconnaissance on the infrastructure.
- File 1, line 1103: `2319,0,6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00`

**Fix:** Evaluate whether this repository needs to be public or accessible beyond the operational team. Consider using environment-specific configuration injection at provisioning time rather than storing endpoints in committed scripts. At minimum, restrict repository access to authorised personnel only and document the data classification of these scripts.

---

**A04-5** — MEDIUM: Primary server IP address committed to version control in File 2

**Description:** File 2 (line 1101) contains register 2319 decoded as the IP address `52.164.241.179`. This is a routable public IP address committed directly to version control. Committing a raw IP address is generally higher risk than a hostname because IP addresses are harder to rotate without reconfiguring all devices, and the IP directly identifies a cloud infrastructure endpoint (the address falls in Microsoft Azure's IP range based on the prefix `52.164.*`). An attacker who obtains this IP can scan the host for open ports and target the server directly.
- File 2, line 1101: `2319,0,35322E3136342E3234312E31373900`

**Fix:** As per A04-4, restrict repository access appropriately. Consider whether scripts should be generated from a configuration management system that injects server addresses at provisioning time, keeping the actual endpoints out of the committed source. Confirm the IP is current and that the service listening on that address has appropriate network-level access controls (firewall, authentication).

---

**A04-6** — INFO: Differing server endpoint types between the two files (hostname vs IP)

**Description:** File 1 targets a hostname (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) while File 2 targets a raw IP (`52.164.241.179`). These may be the same server (the hostname may resolve to that IP) or different servers. The inconsistency is notable: using a raw IP bypasses DNS-based controls (e.g., the ability to redirect traffic by updating DNS), and the two scripts may have been configured independently without cross-checking. If they point to different servers, devices using File 2 may be reporting to a different platform than intended.

**Fix:** Confirm whether `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` resolves to `52.164.241.179`. Standardise on one addressing approach across all scripts (preferably hostname, which supports rotation). Document any intentional differences.

---

**A04-7** — INFO: Non-standard server port 17 used in both files

**Description:** Both files configure register 2312 (server port) to `0x0011` = decimal 17. Port 17 is the historical IANA-assigned "Quote of the Day" port and is not a standard application port for GPS/IoT data ingestion (common choices are 20500, 5001, 8080, 443, etc.). This may be a deliberate proprietary choice by the CalAmp/CI platform, but it is unusual and worth confirming. If the port is misconfigured, devices will fail to report. If this is intentional, the obscure port number provides minimal security-through-obscurity.

**Fix:** Confirm with the platform operator that port 17 is the correct and intended ingestion port. If this is a misconfiguration, correct the register value across all scripts.

---

### Checklist Item 3 — Version Control Risk

**A04-8** — MEDIUM: Operational infrastructure details permanently stored in git history

**Description:** The combination of server hostname (File 1), server IP address (File 2), APN name, and the value in register 2309 (`Kore123`) are all committed to git history and will persist even if the files are later modified. The current branch is clean (no pending changes), meaning these values are in the HEAD commit and all prior commits where these files existed. Git history is not erased by file edits alone.

**Fix:** If any of the committed values are determined to be sensitive (particularly if `Kore123` is a credential — see A04-1), perform a git history rewrite (e.g., `git filter-repo`) to remove the sensitive values from all historical commits, then force-push and require all collaborators to re-clone. For infrastructure endpoints, assess the repository's access controls and restrict accordingly. Going forward, use a secrets/configuration management approach that does not commit live credentials or production endpoints to version control.

---

### Checklist Item 4 — Cross-file Consistency

**A04-9** — INFO: APN field absent from File 2 but present in File 1

**Description:** File 1 explicitly sets register 2306 (APN name) to `data.mono` at both index 0 and index 1. File 2 does not include register 2306 at all. This means devices provisioned with File 2 will use whatever APN is already stored in device memory or the SIM default. The filename of File 2 includes "Telstra Final," suggesting it targets Telstra SIM cards; Telstra's standard IoT APN is `telstra.internet` or `telstra.m2m`, not `data.mono`. The absence of an explicit APN in a Telstra-targeted script is either intentional (SIM pre-provisioned) or an omission that could cause connectivity failures.

**Fix:** Confirm whether Boaroo/Telstra devices require an explicit APN to be programmed. If a specific APN is needed, add register 2306 to File 2 with the correct Telstra APN value. Document the design decision if the omission is intentional.

---

**Checklist item: No issues found** for the following areas:
- No tokens, API keys, or shared-secret fields were identified in any decoded register values beyond those documented above.
- No secondary server (register 2320) is configured in either file.
- The `*22899` SMS shortcode (register 2318) is consistent across both files and is a standard CalAmp provisioning string, not a secret.
- The `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` value in register 2178 appears to be a message format template and is identical across both files; it is not a credential.
- Registers 2314 and 2315 (APN username and password) are absent from both files; no APN authentication credentials are committed.
