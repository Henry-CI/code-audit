## Findings

### 61.137 Rayven and CI clone Matthai DataMono.csv

**A28-1** — MEDIUM: Server hostname committed to git in plaintext

**Description:** Register 2319,0 contains the plaintext server hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`, committed directly to the repository. Register 2319,1 contains the fallback IP address `52.164.241.179` (a Microsoft Azure IP). Committing server endpoints to a version-controlled repository exposes the fleet's telemetry infrastructure to enumeration. If an attacker gains read access to this repository, they can identify the backend server and craft targeted attacks or attempt to impersonate the server. The hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` is a US-specific endpoint not seen in Australian scripts.

**Fix:** Move server endpoint configuration out of committed files. Use environment-specific configuration management, secrets management tooling (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Parameter Store), or at minimum a configuration template with documented substitution instructions. Audit who has read access to this repository.

---

**A28-2** — INFO: APN name `data.mono` committed to git

**Description:** Register 2306 contains the APN name `data.mono` in both indices. This is the DataMono MVNO APN used with a US carrier (likely AT&T or T-Mobile). While APN names are generally not treated as secrets, their presence in a public or broadly accessible repository reduces the effort needed to configure unauthorised devices on the same APN. The APN has no associated username or password in this script (registers 2314 and 2315 are absent), which is normal for open APNs.

**Fix:** Confirm this APN does not require credentials for access. If the APN is carrier-restricted by IMSI or SIM profile, document that control and accept the residual risk. If there is any concern about APN exposure, consider using a configuration template.

---

**A28-3** — INFO: Register 3331 contains masked placeholder `*****`

**Description:** Register 3331,0 is set to `*****` (hex `2A2A2A2A2A00`). This pattern has been observed across multiple files in the repository. The register's purpose is undocumented. The value appears to be a placeholder or masked field rather than a live credential. However, if this field holds a password or PIN at device-runtime that was substituted with stars in this script version, the field should be clarified.

**Fix:** Document the purpose of register 3331 internally. If it is a credential, confirm it is not being set to the literal string `*****` on devices. If it is a placeholder to be substituted at provisioning time, annotate the file accordingly.

---

Checklist item 4 (APN username/password): No issues found. Registers 2314 and 2315 are absent from this file.

Checklist item 5 (Register 2309 credential-like value): No issues found. Register 2309 is absent from this file.

---

### 61.138 Rayven Matthai DataMono.csv

**A28-4** — MEDIUM: Server IP address committed to git in plaintext

**Description:** Register 2319,0 contains the IP address `52.164.241.179` as the sole server endpoint. This is a Microsoft Azure-hosted IP. Unlike 61.137, this file does not include the hostname variant; it points directly to the IP. Committing a server IP to a repository exposes infrastructure directly. The same risks as A28-1 apply: an attacker can use this to identify and target the GPS data collection backend.

**Fix:** Same as A28-1. Move server endpoint values out of committed scripts. Use a configuration management or secrets management pipeline for device provisioning.

---

Checklist item 1 (APN name): APN `data.mono` is committed, same as 61.137. Risk is equivalent to A28-2; not raised as a separate finding to avoid duplication.

Checklist item 4 (APN username/password): No issues found. Registers 2314 and 2315 are absent.

Checklist item 5 (Register 2309 credential-like value): No issues found. Register 2309 is absent.

Checklist item 6 (Register 3331): Same `*****` placeholder as 61.137; see A28-3.

### 61.139 Rayven Mathhai Kore.csv

**A28-5** — HIGH: Credential-like value `Kore123` committed to git in register 2309

**Description:** Register 2309,0 is set to `Kore123` (raw hex `4B6F726531323300`). This is a non-empty, human-readable, credential-like string committed in plaintext to the repository. Based on audit context, register 2309 has been observed carrying values such as `Kore123` in Aus/UK scripts and is classified as HIGH when any value is present. This value is consistent with a default or shared Kore MVNO network credential. Exposing this value in git history means any person with repository access — including future contributors, auditors, or anyone who clones the repo — can read this credential. The credential is also present in git history and cannot be removed simply by editing the file.

**Fix:** Immediately assess whether `Kore123` is an active credential for the Kore MVNO account. If it is: (1) rotate the credential, (2) remove it from the file and replace with a placeholder or environment variable reference, (3) use `git filter-repo` or BFG Repo Cleaner to purge the value from all historical commits, and (4) force-push the cleaned history and invalidate all existing clones. If the value is a default/shared APN credential that is public knowledge, document that determination and downgrade severity accordingly.

---

**A28-6** — HIGH: Carrier name `Kore` in register 2308 reveals MVNO/carrier identity

**Description:** Register 2308,0 contains `Kore` (raw hex `4B6F726500`), identifying the carrier as Kore Wireless, a US IoT MVNO. Combined with the `Kore123` value in register 2309, this provides both the carrier identity and an associated credential in the same file. An attacker with repository access gains sufficient information to target the Kore network relationship.

**Fix:** Remove the carrier name from committed configuration files where it is combined with a credential. If the carrier name alone is required for documentation, ensure it is not co-located with credential values in the same script.

---

**A28-7** — MEDIUM: Server IP address `52.164.241.179` committed to git in plaintext

**Description:** Register 2319,0 contains the IP `52.164.241.179` (same Azure-hosted IP as in 61.138). Same risk as A28-4.

**Fix:** Same as A28-1 and A28-4.

---

Checklist item 3 (APN name register 2306): Register 2306 is absent from 61.139. The Kore carrier configuration relies on registers 2308 and 2309 instead of a traditional APN name field. No additional finding raised.

Checklist item 4 (APN username/password registers 2314/2315): No issues found. Both registers are absent.

Checklist item 6 (Register 3331): Same `*****` placeholder as other files; see A28-3.
