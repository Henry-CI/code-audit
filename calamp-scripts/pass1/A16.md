## Findings

**A16-1** — HIGH: Register 2309 contains credential-like value `Kore123` committed to git in all three files

**Description:** All three files contain register 2309 with hex value `4B6F726531323300`, which decodes to the ASCII string `Kore123`. Based on the security context for this audit (2309 is a known credential-like field seen as "Kore123" in multiple files across the repository), this appears to be a network-access or carrier API credential for the Kore wireless carrier/network. This value is committed in plaintext (hex-encoded, not encrypted) to a git repository. Files affected:
- `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/61.133 Rayven and CI clone Komatsu Telstra Final.csv` (row 1097, `2309,0,4B6F726531323300`)
- `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/61.135 Rayven and CI clone Komatsu Data.mono Final.csv` (row 1099, `2309,0,4B6F726531323300`)
- `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/69.001 RD Komatsu Telstra Final.csv` (row 1097, `2309,0,4B6F726531323300`)

**Fix:** Rotate any credential associated with the value `Kore123` on the Kore platform immediately. Evaluate whether this register stores an authentication credential or simply a carrier identifier; if a credential, remove it from the repository and store it in a secrets management system. Review git history to determine the full exposure window.

**A16-2** — MEDIUM: Server hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` and IP `52.164.241.179` committed to git in two files

**Description:** Register 2319 in files 61.133 and 61.135 contains the primary server FQDN `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (hex `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00`) and a secondary server IP address `52.164.241.179` (hex `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900`). File 69.001 contains `52.164.241.179` as the sole primary server entry. The IP `52.164.241.179` is an Azure-hosted address. Hardcoded production server endpoints in a git repository expose infrastructure topology to anyone with repository access and increase the difficulty of rotating endpoints if a server is compromised or decommissioned.

**Fix:** Treat server endpoints as deployment configuration rather than committed source. Document endpoints in a protected configuration store (e.g., a key vault, deployment pipeline variable, or access-controlled config file excluded from git). Review whether `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` is a customer-specific subdomain that could expose fleet-tracking system identity.

---

**A16-3** — MEDIUM: APN name `data.mono` committed to git in file 61.135

**Description:** Register 2306 (indices 0 and 1) in file 61.135 contains `646174612E6D6F6E6F00`, decoding to `data.mono`. This is the Telstra Data.Mono APN (a real Australian carrier APN name). While APN names are generally low-sensitivity on their own, committing them to a public or broadly-accessible repository alongside operator credentials (register 2309) and server endpoints creates a combined configuration profile that facilitates targeted attacks on the cellular data path. Files 61.133 and 69.001 do not set register 2306 (left absent, implying reliance on a default or previously-set value).

**Fix:** Confirm the repository's access control ensures these scripts are not publicly accessible. Document APNs as deployment parameters rather than committed values where feasible. Ensure 2314 (APN username) and 2315 (APN password) remain absent or blank for this carrier profile, as Telstra data.mono does not require per-device APN credentials.

**A16-4** — LOW: Register 3331 contains masked value `*****` across all three files

**Description:** Register 3331 in all three files contains hex `2A2A2A2A2A00`, which decodes to the five-character string `*****`. This is the same pattern observed in other files in the repository. The asterisk mask suggests this field may hold a PIN, passphrase, or access code that has been partially obfuscated in the script. However, a fixed five-asterisk string committed to the device configuration would either be a literal password of five asterisk characters (a trivially weak credential if so) or a placeholder left from a template. The intent is ambiguous and warrants clarification.

**Fix:** Determine the purpose of register 3331 and whether `*****` is the literal value pushed to devices or a display placeholder. If it represents a real device-level PIN or code, replace with a unique per-device value and manage through a secrets pipeline. If it is a template placeholder that is replaced during device provisioning, document this clearly.

---

**A16-5** — INFO: Register 2318 contains MSISDN dial string `*22899` in all three files

**Description:** Register 2318 decodes to `*22899` in all three files (hex `2A323238393900`). This is a standard Kore network activation dial code, not a sensitive credential. It is consistent across all files and is expected configuration for Kore-connected devices.

**Fix:** No action required. Informational only.

Checklist item 6 (APN credentials — username/password): No issues found. Registers 2314 (APN username) and 2315 (APN password) are absent from all three files. No APN-level credentials are committed.

Checklist item 7 (Secondary server register 2320): No issues found. Register 2320 is not present in any of the three files.
