## Findings

### Finding A12-1

**A12-1** — HIGH: Register 2309 contains a real credential-like value (`Kore123`) committed to git in both files

**Description:** Register 2309,0 decodes to `Kore123` in both `61.36 CI DPWORLD Telstra Final.csv` and `61.37 CI DPWORLD Data.mono Final.csv`. This register has been identified across the repository as a credential-like field. The value `Kore123` appears to be a password associated with the Kore carrier/operator (register 2308 = `Kore`). It is committed in plaintext to the git repository on the main branch, not blanked and not masked. Anyone with read access to the repository — including any future contributors or if the repository is ever exposed — will have access to this credential.

**Fix:** Rotate the `Kore123` credential immediately with the Kore network operator. Replace the value in register 2309 in all script files with a blank (null/empty) value or a documented placeholder token (e.g., `<KORE_PASSWORD>`). Establish a policy that credentials must never be committed to source control; use a secrets management process or inject values at provisioning time.

### Finding A12-2

**A12-2** — MEDIUM: Production server hostnames committed to git in both files

**Description:** Register 2319,0 decodes to `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (primary server) and register 2320,0 decodes to `maint.vehicle-location.com` (secondary server) in both files. These are production fleet-tracking infrastructure hostnames committed in plaintext to the repository. While hostnames alone are not credentials, exposing them in source control reveals the production network architecture to anyone with repository access, facilitates targeted reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts against production endpoints, and creates a long-lived record in git history even if later redacted.

**Fix:** Consider abstracting production server endpoints out of committed configuration files. Use environment-specific placeholder tokens (e.g., `<PRIMARY_SERVER>`, `<SECONDARY_SERVER>`) in committed files, with actual values supplied at provisioning time via a secrets or configuration management system. If hostnames must remain in the repository, ensure repository access controls are appropriately restricted.

### Finding A12-3

**A12-3** — LOW: Register 3331 contains an asterisk-masked value (`*****`) of unknown semantic meaning in both files

**Description:** Register 3331,0 decodes to `*****` (five asterisks) in both files. The purpose of this register is listed as unknown in the audit brief and the asterisk pattern matches the masking pattern seen in other registers across the repository. The value may represent a masked credential or PIN. The semantic meaning is not confirmed from these files alone, but if it is a credential, the masked representation is being committed; this does not protect against reuse in other contexts if the underlying value is known.

**Fix:** Investigate the purpose of register 3331. If it holds a credential or PIN, ensure the underlying value is rotated and that even masked forms are not unnecessarily committed to source control.

### Checklist

**Checklist item 1 (APN credentials in plaintext):** APN username (2314) and APN password (2315) are both set to `dummy` in both files. No real APN credentials are present. No issues found.

**Checklist item 2 (Credential-like field 2309):** Register 2309 contains `Kore123` in both files — a real, non-blank, non-masked value. Reported as Finding A12-1 (HIGH).

**Checklist item 3 (Server endpoints committed to git):** Production hostnames `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` and `maint.vehicle-location.com` are present in both files. Reported as Finding A12-2 (MEDIUM).

**Checklist item 4 (Register 3331 masked/unknown value):** Register 3331 contains `*****` in both files. Reported as Finding A12-3 (LOW).

**Checklist item 5 (APN name disclosure):** APN names `telstra.internet` (61.36) and `data.mono` (61.37) are committed. These are standard public Australian carrier APN strings (Telstra and Telstra Belong/Mono respectively); disclosure presents minimal additional risk beyond what is inherent to using those carriers. No issues found beyond noting their presence.

**Checklist item 6 (Carrier/operator name):** Register 2308 = `Kore` identifies the SIM/connectivity provider. This is informational. No issues found beyond noting its presence.

**Checklist item 7 (GSM dial strings and service codes):** Registers 2316 (`*99***1#`) and 2318 (`*22899`) contain standard GSM USSD/dial strings. These are not credentials and are publicly documented modem AT sequences. No issues found.
