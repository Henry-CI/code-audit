## Findings

**A27-1** — HIGH: Production infrastructure topology committed to version-controlled repository
**Description:** The file `URL & PORTS.xlsx` contains the complete customer-to-endpoint mapping for a GPS telemetry platform: two production inbound server IP addresses (`52.164.241.179`, `52.169.16.32`), one production hostname (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`), one additional production IP (`103.4.235.15`), and 32 distinct per-customer TCP port assignments. Together this data constitutes a detailed network topology map of the production data ingestion infrastructure. This information has been present in the repository since commit `1b25599` (2024-02-02) and has been updated across 12 commits, meaning it exists in the full git history and cannot be expunged without a history rewrite. Any party with read access to this repository — including any future compromise of the repository host — obtains a ready-made target list of live production endpoints and their assigned port numbers.
**Fix:** Remove the file from the repository using `git filter-repo --path "URL & PORTS.xlsx" --invert-paths` (or BFG Repo Cleaner) to purge all historical versions. Replace with a reference to an access-controlled credential/configuration store (e.g., a private secrets manager, internal wiki behind authentication, or a separate private repository). Force-push the rewritten history and rotate/review the exposure of the listed endpoints if the repository has ever been public or shared with untrusted parties.

**A27-2** — MEDIUM: Binary file prevents automated security scanning
**Description:** Excel `.xlsx` files are binary (ZIP-compressed OOXML). Standard git diff tooling, secret-scanning tools (e.g., truffleHog, GitLeaks, GitHub secret scanning), and code review workflows do not inspect binary file contents. All 12 commits that added or updated infrastructure data in this file bypassed any secret-scanning pipeline that might otherwise have flagged the endpoint data. The content was only recoverable here by manual ZIP extraction.
**Fix:** Do not store sensitive configuration data in binary formats in git. If a spreadsheet format is required for operational use, store it outside the repository in a system that supports access control and audit logging. Add a `.gitattributes` rule (e.g., `*.xlsx -diff -merge`) to explicitly mark xlsx files as binary and prevent accidental diffs, and consider a pre-commit hook that blocks binary files containing infrastructure data.

---

**A27-3** — LOW: Local filesystem path of developer workstation leaked in workbook metadata
**Description:** The file `xl/workbook.xml` inside the archive contains the element:
```xml
<x15ac:absPath url="C:\RHM\calamp-scripts\"/>
```
This reveals the absolute local path `C:\RHM\calamp-scripts\` on the developer's workstation. While this is low severity on its own, it discloses the local username directory component (`RHM`) and confirms the operating system (Windows), which contributes to a reconnaissance profile.
**Fix:** When removing the file per A27-1, this metadata is eliminated as well. If a replacement document is ever committed, sanitize Office document metadata before committing using a tool such as `exiftool -all= file.xlsx` or the "Inspect Document / Remove Personal Information" feature in Microsoft Excel.

---

**A27-4** — INFO: No documented ownership or access policy
**Description:** The file is not mentioned in the repository README and there is no indication of who is authorised to read or update the infrastructure data it contains. The document metadata identifies a single author ("Rhythm Duwadi") but there is no access-control boundary enforced by the repository.
**Fix:** If sensitive configuration data must remain in a repository, it should be in a private repository with explicit access controls, an OWNERS or CODEOWNERS file, and documented in the README with a pointer to the authorisation policy.
