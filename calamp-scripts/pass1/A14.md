## Reading Evidence

### FILE: `Aus Script/Keller/61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`

**Row count:** 1229 data rows (plus 1 header row = 1230 lines total)

**All decoded server endpoints (IPs, hostnames, ports):**
- Register 2319 (primary server), index 0: hex `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → `52.164.241.179` (public IP address — Azure cloud range)
- Register 2311 (server port): NOT PRESENT in file
- Register 2320 (secondary server): NOT PRESENT in file

**All decoded APN names (note if truly blank/empty):**
- Register 2306 (APN name): ABSENT — the register does not appear anywhere in the file. This confirms the "Blank APN" description in the filename. When the APN register is absent or empty, the device uses the modem's default/auto-selected APN, meaning it will attempt to attach to any available cellular network without carrier-level restriction.

**APN username (decoded, note blank/dummy/real):**
- Register 2314 (APN username): NOT PRESENT in file

**APN password (decoded, note blank/dummy/real):**
- Register 2315 (APN password): NOT PRESENT in file

**Register 2307 (index 0):** `00` — raw zero byte (operator/APN selection control flag, set to 0)

**Register 2308 (operator/carrier name), index 0:** hex `4B6F726500` → `Kore` (Kore Wireless, IoT MVNO)

**Register 2309 value (decoded):** hex `4B6F726531323300` → `Kore123` — a plaintext credential-like string committed to the repository. This matches the known cross-file pattern flagged as HIGH severity.

**Register 2318 (MSISDN/phone provisioning field), index 0:** hex `2A323238393900` → `*22899` (OTASP activation code; not a direct credential but network-identifiable)

**Register 3331 value (decoded):** hex `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****` — five ASCII asterisks; this register contains a masked/redacted value of unknown purpose, stored as a cleartext mask pattern.

**Register 2178 (index 0):** hex `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` → `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` — appears to be a structured AT command or device template tag string; contains a literal `*` wildcard character within angle-bracket tags; not a cleartext credential but warrants noting.

**Other credential-like values:** None beyond those listed above.

### FILE: `Aus Script/Keller/61.111 Optimal Script for Keller.csv`

**Row count:** 1229 data rows (plus 1 header row = 1230 lines total)

**All decoded server endpoints (IPs, hostnames, ports):**
- Register 2319 (primary server), index 0: hex `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (production tracking platform hostname)
- Register 2311 (server port): NOT PRESENT in file
- Register 2320 (secondary server): NOT PRESENT in file

**All decoded APN names (note if truly blank/empty):**
- Register 2306 (APN name): ABSENT — register does not appear in the file. Same blank-APN condition as file 1, though this file is the "Optimal Script" (production use) rather than a demo.

**APN username (decoded, note blank/dummy/real):**
- Register 2314 (APN username): NOT PRESENT in file

**APN password (decoded, note blank/dummy/real):**
- Register 2315 (APN password): NOT PRESENT in file

**Register 2307 (index 0):** `00` — raw zero byte (same as file 1)

**Register 2308 (operator/carrier name), index 0:** hex `4B6F726500` → `Kore` (same as file 1)

**Register 2309 value (decoded):** hex `4B6F726531323300` → `Kore123` — identical plaintext credential-like string as file 1. HIGH severity.

**Register 2318 (MSISDN/phone provisioning field), index 0:** hex `2A323238393900` → `*22899` (same as file 1)

**Register 3331 value (decoded):** hex `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****` (same as file 1)

### Notable differences between the two files

| Field | 61.101 Blank APN (demo) | 61.111 Optimal Script (production) |
|---|---|---|
| Register 2319 primary server | `52.164.241.179` (raw IP) | `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (hostname) |
| Register 768 index 0 | `34A4F1B3` (device serial/identifier) | `6704EB0F` (different device serial/identifier) |
| Register 769 index 0 | `05DF` | `2AF8` (different value) |
| APN (2306) | Absent (blank — demo context) | Absent (blank — production context, concerning) |
| 2309, 2308, 2318, 3331, 2178 | Identical across both files | Identical across both files |

The most security-significant difference is the server endpoint: the demo file points to a hardcoded public IP address (`52.164.241.179`) while the production optimal script points to a named hostname (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`). Both share the same credential-like value `Kore123` in register 2309 and neither specifies an APN.

## Findings

**A14-1** — HIGH: Plaintext credential-like value "Kore123" committed to repository in both files

**Description:** Register 2309 in both `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` (line 1097) and `61.111 Optimal Script for Keller.csv` (line 1097) contains the hex string `4B6F726531323300`, which decodes to the plaintext string `Kore123`. This value is present in the git history on the main branch and is visible to anyone with repository read access. The value matches a pattern seen across multiple other scripts in this repository (as noted in the audit brief), indicating it is a shared or default credential. Whether this is a network credential, an API key, or a device authentication token, its plaintext storage in version control is a high-severity issue. If `Kore123` represents a real credential for the Kore Wireless MVNO platform, compromise would allow an attacker to authenticate as the account holder, provision or deprovision devices, or intercept telemetry.

**Fix:** Rotate the credential immediately if it is live. Remove the value from the repository and git history (e.g., using `git filter-repo`). Store credentials in a secrets manager or environment-specific configuration that is not committed to version control. If a placeholder must appear in a script template, use an obviously non-functional sentinel such as `REPLACE_WITH_APN_CREDENTIAL`.

**A14-2** — HIGH: Production script (61.111) has blank APN (register 2306 absent)

**Description:** Register 2306 (APN name) is entirely absent from `61.111 Optimal Script for Keller.csv`, which is described as the "Optimal Script" — implying production use for Keller deployments. When no APN is configured, the cellular modem will attempt automatic APN selection or fall back to the device's default APN, meaning the device may attach to any available network rather than being restricted to the intended carrier (Kore Wireless). This bypasses carrier-level access controls, can result in unexpected data roaming charges, and may allow the device to connect via untrusted networks where traffic is not subject to Kore's security policies. The Kore Wireless IoT MVNO provides a specific APN (typically `kore.vzwentp` or similar) that enforces network isolation and private IP allocation; without it, isolation guarantees are void.

**Fix:** Explicitly set register 2306 to the correct Kore Wireless APN string appropriate for the Australian deployment context. Confirm the required APN with Kore Wireless and add it to all production scripts for Keller. Do not rely on automatic APN selection for deployed IoT devices.

---

**A14-3** — MEDIUM: Demo script (61.101) has blank APN (register 2306 absent) — network isolation not enforced in demo mode

**Description:** Register 2306 is absent from `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`. The filename itself acknowledges the blank APN as a deliberate demo configuration. While a demo context may reduce the operational risk compared to a production deployment, the same device hardware is used, and a device operating with a blank APN that also contains the real credential value `Kore123` (register 2309) and a real server endpoint (`52.164.241.179`) represents an actual live connection pathway with reduced network-level controls. Demo devices connecting via uncontrolled APNs could expose the production server IP and credential to a broader set of network observers. Additionally, if a demo script is accidentally applied to a production device (a realistic risk given the shared credential and server), the device will operate without carrier restriction.

**Fix:** For demo scripts that intentionally omit an APN, also neutralise the server endpoint and credential values so that a device using the demo script cannot reach production infrastructure. Alternatively, if the demo requires live connectivity, set the APN explicitly. Document the security implications of blank-APN demo scripts in the repository.

**A14-4** — MEDIUM: Production server hostname committed to repository in plaintext (61.111)

**Description:** Register 2319 in `61.111 Optimal Script for Keller.csv` (line 1101) decodes to `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`. This is a production tracking platform hostname committed to the git repository. Anyone with repository access can identify the tracking platform endpoint, enumerate open ports, probe for vulnerabilities in the server infrastructure, or use this information to craft targeted attacks against the server or its clients. While the hostname alone is not sufficient for an attack, its public disclosure in a repository lowers the barrier for reconnaissance.

**Fix:** Consider whether server endpoint values need to be stored directly in committed configuration files. Options include: injecting server addresses at deployment time from a secrets manager, using a DNS alias that can be rotated without changing device scripts, or at a minimum restricting repository access to authorised personnel only.

---

**A14-5** — MEDIUM: Raw production IP address committed to repository in plaintext (61.101)

**Description:** Register 2319 in `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` (line 1101) decodes to the IP address `52.164.241.179`. This is a publicly routable IP address (in the Azure cloud range) committed to version control. Hardcoded IP addresses are more operationally fragile than hostnames (no DNS-based rotation) and their presence in a repository enables direct targeting of the server without DNS resolution. The combination of a committed IP address with a committed credential (`Kore123`) and a blank APN in the same file increases the overall attack surface.

**Fix:** Replace hardcoded IP addresses with hostnames wherever possible to allow server migration and rotation without re-flashing devices. Remove the IP address from git history if the server has been decommissioned or will be rotated. Restrict repository access.

---

**A14-6** — LOW: Register 3331 contains asterisk-masked value "*****" in both files — purpose unknown

**Description:** Register 3331, index 0, in both files contains hex `2A2A2A2A2A00`, which decodes to the five-character string `*****`. This is an asterisk-masked value whose purpose is not documented in the available register reference. The masking pattern suggests it may have been copied from a UI that masks a sensitive field (such as a password or PIN) and the mask characters themselves were inadvertently committed rather than the actual value. If the device firmware interprets `*****` literally (as a five-asterisk string), it may be a non-functional placeholder. If the firmware instead recognises it as a mask and substitutes a stored value, the actual value is hidden from the config file but may still be accessible on the device.

**Fix:** Identify the purpose of register 3331 from the CalAmp LMU firmware documentation. If it stores a credential or sensitive value, ensure the actual value is not a trivially guessable string. If `*****` is a UI-generated mask that was accidentally committed instead of the real value, re-provision devices with the correct value.

---

**A14-7** — INFO: Register 2308 (operator name) set to "Kore" in both files

**Description:** Register 2308 decodes to `Kore` in both files, identifying the intended MVNO carrier as Kore Wireless. This is a configuration label rather than an authentication credential. No security issue in isolation; noted here for completeness and because it corroborates the context for the `Kore123` value in register 2309.

Checklist item 7 (operator name disclosure): No security issue beyond disclosure of carrier identity, which is LOW risk in context.

---

**A14-8** — INFO: Register 2318 contains OTASP activation code "*22899" in both files

**Description:** Register 2318 decodes to `*22899`, which is a standard OTASP (Over-The-Air Service Provisioning) dial string used by Verizon/Kore-activated devices to trigger SIM provisioning. This is a known public activation code and not a secret. No direct security issue, but its presence confirms devices are provisioned via Verizon's CDMA network stack (or a Kore MVNO variant thereof), which is relevant context for the APN findings above.

Checklist item 8 (OTASP code): No findings — this is a public activation code, not a credential.
