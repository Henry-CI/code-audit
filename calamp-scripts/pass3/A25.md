# Pass 3 Documentation — Agent A25
**Files:** UK Script/ (third batch — all UK Script CSV files)
**Branch:** main
**Date:** 2026-02-28

---

## Scope Clarification

The `UK Script/` directory contains exactly two CSV files. Pass 1 confirmed both are assigned to A25. Since there are only two files in the directory, this agent covers the entire UK Script set, which also constitutes the "last third" (indeed, the only third).

Files covered:
- `UK Script/161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv`
- `UK Script/161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`

## Reading Evidence

### FILE: `UK Script/161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv`

**Total lines:** 1235 (1 header row + 1234 data rows — wc -l reports 1235 because file ends without trailing newline on last data line; confirmed 1234 data rows by offset inspection)

Note: `wc -l` returned 1235 for this file. The first line is the column header `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`. Lines 2–1235 are data rows, giving 1234 data rows total. The last data row is line 1235 (`3333,0,0000`).

**Unique parameter IDs:** 95 distinct parameter_id values, ranging from 256 to 3333.

**Full set of unique parameter_id values:**
256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 283, 285, 286, 291, 512, 513, 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 779, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 913, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1037, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1056, 1280, 1281, 1282, 1283, 1536, 1537, 1539, 1540, 2176, 2178, 2306, 2307, 2311, 2312, 2313, 2319, 2320, 2322, 2327, 3072, 3073, 3074, 3328, 3329, 3330, 3331, 3332, 3333

**Header row (line 1):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`

**Comment lines:** None. No lines beginning with `#`, `//`, `;`, or any other comment marker are present. No inline annotations exist anywhere in the file.

**Key decoded values identified in Pass 1 (relevant to documentation review):**
- Register 2306,0 and 2306,1: `data.mono` (UK SIM carrier APN — MonoMobile)
- Register 2311,0: `5014` hex = port 20500
- Register 2319,0: `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (primary server)
- Register 2320,0: `dm.calamp.co.uk` (secondary server / CalAmp UK DM)
- Register 3331,0: `2A2A2A2A2A00` = `*****` (masked value)

**Filename components:**
- `161.31` — appears to be a version/script number using a `161.xx` scheme
- `CI only` — indicates "CI" (Continuous Integration or Customer Identifier; likely refers to customer "CI" — possibly Crane or a specific customer identifier in the Rayven platform)
- `Data.Mono` — identifies the SIM carrier data APN (`data.mono` = MonoMobile UK)
- `Final` — version qualifier indicating release state
- No explicit customer company name in filename
- No date or semantic version number (e.g., v1.0) in filename
- No country code in filename (country implied only by the parent directory `UK Script/`)

### FILE: `UK Script/161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`

**Total lines:** 1235 (same structure as 161.31)

**Unique parameter IDs:** 95 distinct parameter_id values — identical set to 161.31.

**Header row (line 1):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`

**Comment lines:** None. No annotations of any kind.

**Rows differing from 161.31 (confirmed by diff):** Exactly 4 rows differ:
- `1024,23`: value `1F` (161.31) vs `20` (161.32) — a single-bit flag difference; purpose undocumented
- `2319,0`: primary server — `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (161.31) vs `52.164.241.179` (161.32)
- `768,0`: value `6704EB0F` (161.31) vs `34A4F1B3` (161.32) — likely a device serial/unit ID or IP-as-integer; purpose undocumented
- `769,0`: value `2AF8` (161.31) vs `05DF` (161.32) — likely a port or related numeric value; purpose undocumented

**Filename components:**
- `161.32` — version/script number, incremented from 161.31
- `Rayven Demo` — identifies this as a Rayven platform demo configuration
- `DataMono` — SIM carrier identifier (MonoMobile, `data.mono` APN)
- `Final` — version qualifier
- No explicit customer company name in filename
- No date or semantic version number in filename
- No country code in filename (country implied only by parent directory)

### Supporting Repository Documentation

**README.md (repo root):** States the repo holds "scripts created for the Rayven CI transfer" and that scripts are "divided based on country with where the script sends data to mentioned on the name along with the type of SIM the script is for." Mentions a "registers" document should exist for new scripts. No such registers document was found anywhere in the repository.

**`URL & PORTS.xlsx`:** Present at repo root. Contents not inspectable as a binary Excel file, but the filename suggests it may document server endpoints and ports. This is the only candidate for register or endpoint documentation.

**`CALAMP APPS/` directory:** Contains `LMUMgr_8.9.10.7.zip`, `LMUToolbox_V41`, and `AppendCRC16ToBin`. No parameter register documentation file found within.

**Other directories:** `Aus Script/`, `US Script/`, `Demo Script/`, `8bit Script/` — none contain README or documentation files.

**No register documentation file exists anywhere in the repository.** The README references a "registers" document but it is absent.

## Findings

**[A25-D1]** — HIGH: No inline documentation in any UK Script CSV file

**Description:** Neither `161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv` nor `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` contains any comment lines, descriptive headers beyond the bare column names (`parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`), or any form of inline annotation. A CSV file with 1234 data rows spanning 95 distinct parameter IDs is entirely opaque without documentation. An engineer reading either file has no way to determine: what device behaviour each parameter block configures, what the intended reporting intervals or thresholds are, which parameters are critical vs. default-fill, or what distinguishes this script from others. This gap directly increases the risk of misconfiguration during maintenance, because parameters can be changed without understanding their purpose.

**Fix:** Add a comment block at the top of each CSV file (using a `#`-prefixed comment convention if the LMU Manager tool supports it, or as a companion `.txt` or `.md` sidecar file) that documents at minimum: the target customer, the target platform/server, the SIM carrier and APN, the intended device behaviour (reporting interval, geofence logic, event triggers), the date of last change, and the author. If the LMU Manager tool does not support comment lines in CSV, create a `UK Script/README.md` that documents each file's purpose.

---

**[A25-D2]** — HIGH: No register/parameter ID documentation exists in the repository

**Description:** The repository README states "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'" — referencing a "registers" document. No such document exists anywhere in the repository. The 95 parameter IDs used in the UK Script files (ranging from 256 to 3333) are entirely undocumented within the codebase. Without a parameter reference, an engineer cannot determine the purpose of any given ID, cannot audit for misconfiguration, and cannot safely modify values. This is a systemic documentation gap that affects the entire repository, not only the UK Script files. The only candidate for partial documentation is the binary `URL & PORTS.xlsx` file at the repo root, which is not version-controlled in a reviewable format and whose contents cannot be inspected without Excel.

**Fix:** Create a `REGISTERS.md` or equivalent human-readable document in the repository root that maps each parameter_id to its CalAmp LMU register name, data type, units, and valid range. At minimum, document the registers that carry security-sensitive values: 2306 (APN), 2309 (credential), 2311 (port), 2314/2315 (APN credentials), 2319/2320 (primary/secondary server), 3331 (masked field). Reference the CalAmp LMU/PETI programmer's reference for the full parameter set. Convert `URL & PORTS.xlsx` to a plain-text or Markdown format so it is diff-able in version control.

---

**[A25-D3]** — MEDIUM: Customer identity is ambiguous or absent from UK Script filenames

**Description:** The filename `161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv` uses the abbreviation "CI" to identify the customer or configuration target. "CI" is not defined anywhere in the repository — it could refer to a specific customer ("Crane Industries", a named company), a platform concept ("Continuous Integration"), or something else entirely. The filename `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` identifies the platform (Rayven) and purpose (Demo) but does not name an end-customer. In contrast, scripts in the `Aus Script/` directory use explicit customer names (e.g., `Komatsu_AU`, `Keller`, `DPWorld`, `CEA`). The UK Script files do not follow this naming convention. As a result, it is not possible to determine from the repository alone which customer or account each UK script belongs to, creating a risk of scripts being applied to the wrong customer's devices.

**Fix:** Rename files to include the full customer name rather than an abbreviation. Apply the naming convention used in the Aus Script directory: `{CustomerName}_{Country}_{Carrier}_{Purpose}_{Version}.csv`. For example: `CI_{FullCustomerName}_UK_DataMono_Production_v161.31.csv`. Update the README to document the naming convention formally. Define what "CI" stands for in existing documentation immediately.

---

**[A25-D4]** — MEDIUM: No version history or change log for UK Script files

**Description:** Both UK Script filenames carry the suffix `Final` as their only version qualifier. There is no date, semantic version number (e.g., v1.0), or changelog indicating when the scripts were created or last modified, what changed between 161.31 and 161.32, or what the version `161.xx` numbering scheme means. The diff between the two files reveals four differing rows — including a change to a flag register (1024,23), two device-identity-like registers (768,0 and 769,0), and the critical primary server address (2319,0) — but none of these differences are explained anywhere. An engineer maintaining these scripts cannot determine the history of changes or the rationale for the differences without inspecting git blame, and even git history may not contain descriptive commit messages explaining parameter-level changes.

**Fix:** Establish a change log convention for each script file. This can be a companion `CHANGELOG.md` in the `UK Script/` directory or embedded in a sidecar file per script. Each entry should document: version number, date, author, and a human-readable description of what changed and why. The `161.xx` version numbering scheme should be defined (what does `161` represent? what triggers an increment of the `.xx` part?).

---

**[A25-D5]** — MEDIUM: No documentation distinguishing UK Script purpose from Demo Script and other directories

**Description:** The repository contains a `Demo Script/` directory with a file named `61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv`, which serves a similar purpose to `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` in the UK Script directory. Both appear to be Rayven demo configurations using the MonoMobile APN. There is no documentation explaining: why one demo script lives in `UK Script/` and another lives in `Demo Script/`, what the difference between them is, whether `UK Script/161.32` is a UK-specific demo or a general Rayven demo that was placed in the wrong directory, or what the deployment scope of each directory is. This creates confusion about which script to use for UK Rayven demo deployments.

**Fix:** Add a `README.md` to the `UK Script/` directory that explicitly states: which customers each file serves, the deployment environment (production vs. demo), and the relationship of these scripts to files in other directories (particularly `Demo Script/`). Clarify whether `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` is intended for UK-specific demo deployments only, or if it duplicates content from `Demo Script/`.

---

**[A25-D6]** — LOW: Country not encoded in UK Script filenames

**Description:** The README states scripts are "divided based on country with where the script sends data to mentioned on the name." However, neither UK Script filename contains a country code or country name. The country is implied only by the parent directory (`UK Script/`). If a file is moved, shared, or referenced outside its directory context (e.g., via a direct path, a deployment manifest, or an email attachment), the country association is lost. Other directories such as `Aus Script/` contain subdirectories with customer names but similarly lack country codes in individual filenames. The UK Script files are particularly at risk because both files are at the flat root of the `UK Script/` directory with no subdirectory structure to reinforce geography.

**Fix:** Encode the country (e.g., `UK`) directly in each filename as part of a standardised naming convention. Example: `161.31_UK_CI_DataMono_Final.csv`. This is a low-effort change that provides clear provenance when files are referenced outside their directory.

---

**[A25-D7]** — LOW: `URL & PORTS.xlsx` is a binary file in version control and not reviewable as documentation

**Description:** The file `URL & PORTS.xlsx` at the repository root is likely the closest thing to endpoint/infrastructure documentation in this repository. However, as a binary Excel file: (1) it cannot be reviewed in a git diff; (2) changes to it are opaque in version history; (3) it cannot be read by automated tooling or CI pipelines without specialised libraries; (4) its contents could not be inspected during this audit without Excel. Storing infrastructure documentation in a binary format in a git repository is an antipattern that undermines the value of version control for documentation.

**Fix:** Convert `URL & PORTS.xlsx` to a plain Markdown table or CSV file (e.g., `URL_AND_PORTS.md`) and commit it in place of the Excel file. If the Excel file must be retained for formatting reasons, also maintain a plain-text equivalent that is kept in sync. Remove the `.xlsx` from version control if it is not being actively maintained.

---

**[A25-D8]** — INFO: `161.xx` version numbering scheme is undefined

**Description:** The script numbering scheme `161.31` and `161.32` is not defined anywhere in the repository. The README does not explain what `161` represents as a prefix (it could be a product line code, a project number, a CalAmp firmware version target, or an arbitrary internal identifier). The `.31` and `.32` suffixes suggest sequential versioning, but no rules for when to increment are documented. Other directories use different numbering: `Demo Script/` has `61.142`, suggesting the prefix itself varies across directories. Without a defined scheme, engineers cannot determine what constitutes a new version, when to create a new file vs. edit an existing one, or how to number future scripts.

**Fix:** Add a section to `README.md` (or a new `CONTRIBUTING.md`) that defines the version numbering scheme: what the prefix `161` means, what triggers a suffix increment, and how this relates to scripts in other directories (e.g., `61.142` in Demo Script). This is a documentation hygiene issue with no security implication but material operational risk.
