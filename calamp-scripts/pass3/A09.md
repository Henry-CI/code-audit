## Reading Evidence

### Repository-level documentation

**README.md** (repository root) contains four items relevant to this audit:

1. The repository purpose is described as containing "all the new scripts created for the Rayven CI transfer", divided by country, with the carrier identified in the filename.
2. Setup instructions reference "LMU Manager" as the tool for editing CSV files.
3. The README mentions that new scripts should have "a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'", implying a separate version registry exists — however no such registry file is present in the repository.
4. A single named contact is given (`Rhythm Duwadi`) for new scripts or changes.

The README contains no mention of demo scripts, no guidance on when demo scripts should be used, no distinction between demo and production scripts, and no list of which registers are in use.

### FILE: `Demo Script/61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv`

**Full path:** `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/Demo Script/61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv`

**Row count:** 1231 data rows + 1 header row = 1232 lines total.

**Header row present:** Yes — line 1 is `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`. This is the standard CalAmp LMU Manager CSV column header. It identifies column roles but provides no script-level metadata (no device type, no customer, no version, no purpose).

**Comment lines present:** None. The CSV format has no comment syntax; no workaround (e.g., a dedicated metadata parameter ID) is used.

**Filename analysis:**

| Component | Present? | Value |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Version/series number | Yes | `61.142` |
| "Demo" label | Yes | `Demo` |
| Platform/integration | Yes | `Rayven` |
| SIM carrier | Yes | `datamono` (Monogoto `data.mono` APN) |
| Customer name | No | — |
| Country | No | — |
| Device type | No | — |
| Script purpose beyond "demo" | No | — |
| "Final" or release marker | No | Absent (contrast production files which append `Final`) |

The word "Demo" appears only in the filename, not within the file content.

**Unique parameter IDs used (by register group):**

| Register range | IDs present |
|---------------|-------------|
| 256–291 | 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 283, 285, 286, 291 |
| 512–515 | 512 (indices 0–249), 513 (indices 0–233), 515 (indices 235–249) |
| 768–779 | 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 779 |
| 902–913 | 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 913 |
| 1024–1056 | 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1037, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1056 |
| 1280–1283 | 1280, 1281, 1282, 1283 |
| 1536–1540 | 1536, 1537, 1538, 1539, 1540 |
| 2178–2327 | 2178, 2306, 2307, 2308, 2309, 2312, 2313, 2318, 2319, 2327 |
| 3072–3074 | 3072, 3073, 3074 |
| 3328–3333 | 3328, 3329, 3330, 3331, 3332, 3333 |

**Total distinct parameter IDs:** approximately 60 unique register IDs across approximately 1231 rows. No parameter ID documentation is present in the repository.

**Key credential and endpoint registers decoded:**

| Row | Register | Hex value | Decoded value |
|-----|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1095 | 2306,0 | `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` | `data.mono` |
| 1096 | 2306,1 | `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` | `data.mono` |
| 1098 | 2308,0 | `4B6F726500` | `Kore` |
| 1099 | 2309,0 | `4B6F726531323300` | `Kore123` |
| 1102 | 2318,0 | `2A323238393900` | `*22899` |
| 1103 | 2319,0 | `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` | `52.164.241.179` |
| 1229 | 3331,0 | `2A2A2A2A2A00` | `*****` |

**Comparison with production CEA scripts:**

The credential and network configuration registers in `61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` are byte-for-byte identical to those in the production file `Aus Script/CEA/69.004 RD CEA Monogoto Final.csv`:

- Register 2306 (APN): identical (`data.mono` x2)
- Register 2308 (APN operator): identical (`Kore`)
- Register 2309 (credential): identical (`Kore123`)
- Register 2318 (SMS callback): identical (`*22899`)
- Register 2319,0 (server IP): identical (`52.164.241.179`)
- Register 3331 (masked field): identical (`*****`)

The demo script has **no safe/sandbox server endpoint**. It points to the same production IP (`52.164.241.179`) as the CEA production scripts. The only differences between the demo script and its nearest production equivalent (`69.004 RD CEA Monogoto Final.csv`) that are apparent from file metadata are: the directory (`Demo Script/` vs `Aus Script/CEA/`), the version number in the filename (`61.142` vs `69.004`), the presence of "Demo" in the filename, and the absence of "Final" in the demo filename.

**Other demo-adjacent files in the repository (for context):**

- `Aus Script/Keller/61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` — contains "Demo" in filename, located under a production customer subfolder
- `UK Script/161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` — contains "Demo" in filename, located under a production country folder

These demonstrate that the "demo" labelling convention is applied inconsistently across the repository: some demo files reside in the `Demo Script/` directory, others reside in customer or country subfolders alongside production scripts.

## Findings

---

**[A09-1]** — HIGH: Demo script contains live production credentials and server endpoint with no safe-mode differentiation

**Description:** The file `Demo Script/61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` carries identical credential and network configuration values to the production CEA Monogoto script (`69.004 RD CEA Monogoto Final.csv`). Specifically, register 2309,0 decodes to `Kore123` (a known carrier credential), and register 2319,0 decodes to `52.164.241.179` (the production server IP). Any device loaded with this "demo" script will authenticate to the production Kore network using the production credential and will transmit data to the production server. There is no demo-specific APN, no sandbox server, and no stub credential. A technician using this script for a demonstration would silently inject demo-device data into the production data stream, potentially contaminating production telemetry, or consume production connectivity entitlements.

**Fix:** Create a distinct demo server endpoint (or a dedicated demo account on the existing server) and substitute it for `52.164.241.179` in all demo scripts. Replace the `Kore123` credential with a demo-specific credential that has no production access. Document clearly in the CSV filename or a companion README that demo scripts must not use production endpoints or credentials. Treat the current state as equivalent to a production misconfiguration risk until corrected.

**[A09-2]** — HIGH: "Demo" designation exists only in the filename; the file content is indistinguishable from a production script

**Description:** The sole indicator that `61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` is a demo rather than a production script is the word "Demo" in the filename. There are no comment rows, no header metadata, no registry entry, and no companion documentation file indicating the script's purpose, intended audience, or usage constraints. Because the CSV format does not support comments, the file body is structurally identical to all other production scripts. An operator using the LMU Manager to open and deploy this script has no in-tool indication that it is a demo script. If the file were renamed or moved, all trace of its demo status would be lost.

**Fix:** Adopt a lightweight in-file convention to mark demo scripts distinctly. Options include: (a) reserving a dummy parameter ID (e.g., a vendor-unused register) as a metadata marker set to a value that encodes "DEMO"; (b) using a naming convention that is enforced at the directory level (all files in `Demo Script/` are demo) and documenting this policy in the README; or (c) requiring a companion `.txt` or `.md` file for every demo script that describes its purpose, target device, and deployment restrictions. At minimum, the README must be updated to define what "demo" means operationally and who is authorised to use demo scripts.

---

**[A09-3]** — MEDIUM: No version registry or mapping between demo scripts and their production counterparts exists

**Description:** The README states that new scripts should have "a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'", but no version registry file exists in the repository. The naming scheme (`61.142` for the demo vs `61.141` and `69.004` for related production CEA scripts) uses a numerical series that carries implicit meaning to those who know the convention but is undocumented. There is no explicit record of which production script `61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` was derived from, what changes were made to produce the demo variant, or whether the demo script is current with respect to its production parent.

**Fix:** Create and maintain a version registry file (e.g., `VERSIONS.md` or a structured CSV) that records for each script: its filename, version number, parent script (if derived), customer, country, carrier, device type, purpose (demo/production), and last-modified date. Require that any demo script entry in the registry identifies its corresponding production script and the differences between them.

---

**[A09-4]** — MEDIUM: Demo scripts are not consistently isolated in a dedicated directory

**Description:** Two other demo-labelled files exist in the repository but are stored in customer/country subfolders rather than in `Demo Script/`:

- `Aus Script/Keller/61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` — in a production customer folder
- `UK Script/161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` — in a production country folder

The inconsistent placement means the `Demo Script/` directory does not serve as a reliable boundary for identifying demo scripts. An operator or auditor cannot determine the full set of demo scripts by inspecting a single location. Additionally, `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` carries the `Final` suffix, which is otherwise used exclusively on production scripts, blurring the demo/production distinction further.

**Fix:** Establish and enforce a single canonical location for all demo scripts (the existing `Demo Script/` directory is appropriate). Move all demo-labelled scripts currently residing in production customer or country folders into `Demo Script/` or into customer-specific subdirectories under `Demo Script/`. Update the README to document this convention. Prohibit the use of `Final` in demo script filenames.

---

**[A09-5]** — MEDIUM: No inline documentation of register IDs; parameter IDs are undocumented within the repository

**Description:** The CSV files use numeric parameter IDs (e.g., 2309, 2319, 3331) with no inline documentation. The README makes no reference to a register reference document or CalAmp LMU parameter specification. The README mentions "registers" only in the context of a version registry, not a parameter dictionary. An operator reading the CSV has no way to determine what each parameter ID controls without access to a separate CalAmp device manual. This is a documentation gap that affects all scripts in the repository, including the demo script, and creates risk that incorrect parameters may be set or that security-sensitive parameters (such as credentials in register 2309) may be modified without awareness of their function.

**Fix:** Add a `REGISTERS.md` or `registers.csv` reference file to the repository that maps the parameter IDs used across the scripts to their CalAmp documentation names and a brief functional description. At minimum, document the security-relevant registers: 2306 (APN name), 2307 (APN slot control), 2308 (APN operator/username), 2309 (APN password/credential), 2319 (server hostname/IP), 3331 (PIN/access field). Link to the relevant CalAmp LMU programmer reference.

**[A09-6]** — LOW: Filename omits country and device-type fields, reducing traceability

**Description:** The production naming convention used across the repository encodes: version number, customer name, country (implicitly via folder), carrier, and a `Final` release marker (e.g., `69.004 RD CEA Monogoto Final.csv`). The demo script filename `61.142 Demo Rayven datamono.csv` omits the customer name and the `Final` marker, and does not encode the country. The README states that the naming should include "where the script sends data to" and "the type of SIM", but this convention is applied inconsistently. Without a customer name in the filename, it is unclear which customer the demo is intended to represent (CEA, Keller, or a generic demonstration).

**Fix:** Standardise the filename convention to require: `[version].[subversion] [Customer] [Demo|Final] [Platform] [Carrier].csv`. Apply this convention retroactively to all existing demo scripts. Add the convention to the README with examples.

---

**[A09-7]** — LOW: README provides no usage guidance for demo scripts

**Description:** The repository README describes the general purpose of the repository and names a single contact, but provides no guidance specific to demo scripts: no description of what a demo is, no list of who is authorised to load demo scripts onto devices, no instructions on how demo scripts differ from production scripts, no warning that demo scripts must not be used in production deployments, and no process for creating or retiring demo scripts. Given that the demo script in this audit contains production credentials and a production server endpoint, the absence of usage guidance is a meaningful risk factor.

**Fix:** Add a dedicated "Demo Scripts" section to the README covering: what demo scripts are, which directory they live in, what makes a script a demo (e.g., should use sandbox endpoints and demo credentials), who may use them, under what circumstances they may be loaded onto a device, and how to request a new demo script.
