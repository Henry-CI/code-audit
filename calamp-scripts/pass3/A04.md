# Pass 3 Documentation — Agent A04
**Files:** Aus Script/ (first batch)
**Branch:** main
**Date:** 2026-02-28

---

## Scope

Pass 1 confirmed two assigned files:

1. `Aus Script/61.61 General for CI old dashboard datamono.csv`
2. `Aus Script/Boaroo/69.005 Rayven Boaroo Telstra Final.csv`

All 16 CSV files in `Aus Script/` (including subdirectories) were enumerated via glob to establish alphabetical order and confirm which constitute the first half. The two files above are assigned to this agent per Pass 1.

---

## External Documentation Survey

The following supporting documents were identified at repository root:

| File | Content Relevant to These Scripts |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Describes repo purpose (CalAmp LMU scripts for Rayven CI transfer), naming convention intent (country + SIM carrier in name), and mentions that new scripts must be registered in a "registers" document. No register-to-name mapping provided. |
| `URL & PORTS.xlsx` | Present at root. Not a text file; content not readable by this toolchain. Likely contains server URL and port reference information. |

No README, manifest, or parameter-mapping document was found inside `Aus Script/` or its `Boaroo/` subdirectory. No `.txt`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.rst`, or `.md` file exists anywhere under `Aus Script/`.

## Reading Evidence

### FILE 1: `Aus Script/61.61 General for CI old dashboard datamono.csv`

**Row count:** 1232 total (1 header row + 1231 data rows)

**Header row (line 1):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`

**Comment lines:** None. No rows beginning with `#`, `//`, or any non-numeric token other than the column header.

**Unique parameter IDs present (count: ~95 distinct IDs):**
256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 283, 285, 286, 291, 512, 513, 515, 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 779, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 913, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1037, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1056, 1280, 1281, 1282, 1283, 1536, 1537, 1538, 1539, 1540, 2178, 2306, 2307, 2308, 2309, 2312, 2313, 2318, 2319, 2327, 3072, 3073, 3074, 3328, 3329, 3330, 3331, 3332, 3333

**Filename analysis:**
- Prefix `61.61` — appears to be a script version number (major.minor format). The `61.` prefix is shared with other scripts in the repository (e.g., `61.36`, `61.37`, `61.101`, `61.111`, `61.133`, `61.135`, `61.140`, `61.141`).
- `General for CI` — "CI" likely refers to "Connectivity Intelligence" (the platform/dashboard brand). The word "General" indicates this is not customer-specific.
- `old dashboard` — explicitly flags this as a legacy script tied to an old dashboard version. No date or deprecation marker accompanies this label.
- `datamono` — identifies the SIM carrier/APN: Monogoto (data.mono APN), confirmed by register 2306 decoded value `data.mono`.
- Country not stated in filename; implied by directory `Aus Script/`.
- Device model not stated.
- No customer name present (this is a generic/baseline script).

**Notable encoded values decoded:**
- Reg 2319,0: `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (server hostname)
- Reg 2312,0: `0011` → port 17
- Reg 2306,0 and 2306,1: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → `data.mono` (APN)
- Reg 2308,0: `4B6F726500` → `Kore`
- Reg 2309,0: `4B6F726531323300` → `Kore123`
- Reg 2318,0: `2A323238393900` → `*22899`
- Reg 2178,0: `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` → `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`
- Reg 3331,0: `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****`
- Reg 768,0: `6704EB0F` (device-specific seed)
- Reg 769,0: `2AF8` (device-specific seed)

### FILE 2: `Aus Script/Boaroo/69.005 Rayven Boaroo Telstra Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1230 total (1 header row + 1229 data rows)

**Header row (line 1):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`

**Comment lines:** None. No rows beginning with `#`, `//`, or any non-numeric token other than the column header.

**Unique parameter IDs present (count: ~94 distinct IDs):**
Same set as File 1 with one omission: register 2306 (APN name) is absent. All other parameter IDs are present.

**Filename analysis:**
- Prefix `69.005` — script version number. The `69.` prefix appears to be a distinct major-version series (other examples: `69.001`, `69.002`, `69.003`, `69.004`). The `69.` series may indicate a different device model or firmware generation relative to the `61.` series.
- `Rayven` — identifies the platform/dashboard target (Rayven IoT platform).
- `Boaroo` — identifies the customer. Placement in `Aus Script/Boaroo/` subdirectory reinforces this.
- `Telstra` — identifies the SIM carrier (Telstra, Australia's largest mobile operator).
- `Final` — indicates script status (production-ready). No version date accompanies this status marker.
- Country not stated in filename; implied by directory `Aus Script/`.
- Device model not stated.

**Notable encoded values decoded:**
- Reg 2319,0: `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → `52.164.241.179` (server IP address)
- Reg 2312,0: `0011` → port 17
- Reg 2306: absent (no APN configured)
- Reg 2308,0: `4B6F726500` → `Kore` (identical to File 1)
- Reg 2309,0: `4B6F726531323300` → `Kore123` (identical to File 1)
- Reg 2318,0: `2A323238393900` → `*22899` (identical to File 1)
- Reg 2178,0: `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` → `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` (identical to File 1)
- Reg 3331,0: `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****` (identical to File 1)
- Reg 768,0: `34A4F1B3` (device-specific seed, differs from File 1)
- Reg 769,0: `05EB` (device-specific seed, differs from File 1)

## Findings

**[A04-1]** — HIGH: No inline documentation — filenames carry all context and that context is incomplete

**Description:** Neither file contains any comment rows, metadata lines, section headings, or explanatory annotations. The CSV body consists entirely of raw hex-encoded register values with no human-readable labels. A person reading either file without access to the CalAmp LMU register reference manual cannot determine what any individual row does. For example, register 512 (the largest block, with 250 indices) is entirely opaque — its role as the LMU event/action mapping table is not indicated anywhere in the file. Register 2319 (server address), 2306 (APN), 2309 (value `Kore123`), and 3331 (value `*****`) carry no inline explanation of their purpose. The CalAmp LMU configuration format does not natively support comment rows, but nothing prevents adding a preamble section of dummy rows or maintaining a companion sidecar file. Neither approach has been adopted. This gap applies uniformly across both files.

**Fix:** For each script, create a sidecar companion file (e.g., `61.61 General for CI old dashboard datamono.notes.txt`) in the same directory that documents: (1) device model targeted, (2) customer or "generic" designation, (3) platform/dashboard version the script is written for, (4) SIM carrier and APN, (5) server address and port configured, (6) date last modified and by whom, and (7) a plain-English summary of the behavioral intent (event intervals, I/O configuration, etc.). Alternatively, adopt a structured metadata header convention — since the LMU Manager ignores unrecognised rows — or maintain a central manifest CSV/spreadsheet mapping each filename to its descriptive metadata.

---

**[A04-2]** — HIGH: No register-to-name mapping available within the repository

**Description:** The scripts collectively configure approximately 95 distinct parameter IDs across hundreds of index entries. None of these IDs are mapped to human-readable names anywhere in the repository. The README references "the registers" as a place where new scripts must be registered, implying some external register mapping document is expected to exist, but no such file is present in the repository. The only supporting file at root level is `URL & PORTS.xlsx`, which addresses server endpoints only and does not provide a register dictionary. Without a register map, a reviewer cannot determine the purpose or security implications of any given row without independently consulting the CalAmp LMU documentation — a manual that is proprietary and not bundled here. This makes security review, change management, and onboarding of new engineers significantly harder.

**Fix:** Commit a register reference document (even a partial one covering the registers actively used by these scripts) to the repository. At minimum, document the security-relevant registers: 2178, 2306, 2307, 2308, 2309, 2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, 2318, 2319, 2320, 3331. A simple CSV file with columns `parameter_id`, `name`, `description`, `data_type`, `security_notes` would serve this purpose. The CalAmp LMU Application Programmer's Guide (publicly available in older revisions) contains the full register table and could be used as the source.

**[A04-3]** — MEDIUM: Filename naming convention is inconsistent between the two files and across the broader `Aus Script/` directory

**Description:** The two assigned files demonstrate inconsistent naming conventions:
- File 1 (`61.61 General for CI old dashboard datamono.csv`) uses a free-text descriptive label with no customer name, includes the word "old" to indicate legacy status, and places the APN carrier at the end. It resides directly in `Aus Script/` rather than a customer subdirectory.
- File 2 (`69.005 Rayven Boaroo Telstra Final.csv`) uses platform + customer + carrier + status ordering and resides in a customer subdirectory (`Aus Script/Boaroo/`).

Comparing to the other files visible in the glob output, the broader directory shows additional inconsistencies: some scripts prefix platform (`Rayven and CI clone`), some omit platform, some use `RD` prefix (meaning unknown from filename alone), some use `Final` suffix, and version number series (`50.`, `61.`, `69.`) overlap without documented meaning. The README states the naming convention should include "country" and "type of SIM," but country is never present in any filename (only implied by directory placement), and the SIM carrier token is sometimes absent or abbreviated inconsistently (e.g., `Telsta` in `61.140 Rayven and CI clone CEA Telsta Final.csv` — apparent typo).

Specific to this batch:
- File 1 does not follow the `[version] [platform] [customer] [carrier] [status]` pattern used by File 2.
- File 1 uses "old dashboard" as a status descriptor rather than a structured status token.
- No date, semantic versioning, or change history is embedded in either filename.

**Fix:** Define and document a canonical filename template, for example: `[version].[minor] [Platform] [Customer] [Carrier] [Status] [YYYY-MM-DD].csv`. Apply this consistently to all files, renaming existing files to conform. The README should be updated to specify the exact template with examples. Files that are deprecated or legacy should use an explicit `[DEPRECATED]` or `[LEGACY]` token rather than embedded prose like "old dashboard."

---

**[A04-4]** — MEDIUM: File 1 is explicitly labelled "old dashboard" but remains in active version control alongside current scripts with no deprecation, expiry, or replacement marker

**Description:** The filename `61.61 General for CI old dashboard datamono.csv` contains the phrase "old dashboard," explicitly identifying this as a script for a superseded dashboard/platform version. It is committed to the `main` branch alongside current production scripts with no indication of: (a) which dashboard version it refers to, (b) when it was superseded, (c) whether devices are still provisioned with it, (d) what the replacement script is, or (e) whether it should be removed. Retaining actively used but undocumented "old" scripts in main creates the risk that the script is inadvertently applied to new devices, or that operators cannot determine which scripts are current.

**Fix:** Add inline or sidecar documentation (per A04-1 fix) specifying the dashboard version this script targets and its current lifecycle status. If the script is no longer used, move it to a clearly named `archive/` or `deprecated/` subdirectory or tag it with a `[DEPRECATED YYYY-MM-DD]` suffix and remove it from the provisioning workflow. If it is still in use, rename it to remove the word "old" and document why it remains alongside newer variants.

---

**[A04-5]** — MEDIUM: The README references a "registers" document that does not exist in the repository

**Description:** The README states: "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'." This implies a central register or manifest document where scripts are tracked, but no file named "registers" (in any format) exists anywhere in the repository. The instruction is therefore unenforceable — engineers creating new scripts have no register to update, and there is no inventory of what scripts exist, what version they are, who created them, or when. This creates a documentation governance gap: the intended process exists only as an unfulfilled aspiration in the README.

**Fix:** Create the referenced "registers" document (a spreadsheet or structured text file) and commit it to the repository. It should contain one row per script file with columns for: filename, script version, customer, carrier/APN, server address, device model, status (active/deprecated/test), date created, date last modified, and author. Enforce updates to this register as part of the script commit workflow (e.g., via a pull request checklist or a pre-commit hook that checks for a corresponding register entry).

---

**[A04-6]** — LOW: Version number semantics for the `61.` and `69.` prefix series are undocumented

**Description:** File 1 carries version prefix `61.61` and File 2 carries `69.005`. The broader `Aus Script/` directory contains files with prefixes `50.`, `61.`, and `69.`. These prefix series are not explained anywhere. They may denote device firmware compatibility levels, script template generations, or simply sequential version numbers assigned by the author. The distinction matters operationally: if `69.` scripts are firmware-specific, applying a `61.` script to a device expecting `69.` configuration (or vice versa) could result in misconfiguration or loss of connectivity. Without documentation, there is no way to determine the correct version series for a given device.

**Fix:** Document the meaning of the version prefix series in the README or in the "registers" document (see A04-5). Specify: what each major version series (`50.`, `61.`, `69.`) represents, what device firmware or hardware revision it targets, and whether scripts from different series are interchangeable. Include guidance on how to select the correct version for a new device deployment.

---

**[A04-7]** — LOW: Device-specific seed values (registers 768 and 769) are embedded in both scripts with no explanation

**Description:** Both files contain registers 768 and 769 at index 0 with unique non-zero values (File 1: `6704EB0F` / `2AF8`; File 2: `34A4F1B3` / `05EB`). These values differ between files and are device-specific. Their purpose (likely a device hardware ID, encryption seed, or calibration constant) is not explained anywhere in the file, the README, or any companion document. If these registers are device-specific identifiers or cryptographic seeds, committing them to a shared script creates a risk that the same seed value is applied to multiple devices, defeating whatever uniqueness property the register is intended to provide. If they are calibration constants that happen to differ by revision, that is not documented either.

**Fix:** Document the purpose of registers 768 and 769 in the register reference document (per A04-2 fix). If these are device-specific values that must differ per device, they should not be hardcoded in a shared provisioning script; instead, they should be injected at provisioning time from a device-specific configuration database. If they are shared constants that happen to vary by script variant, document that explicitly.

---

**[A04-8]** — INFO: No external purpose/variant documentation explains how File 1 ("General") differs behaviourally from File 2 ("Boaroo Telstra")

**Description:** The two files differ in: server address type (hostname vs. IP), presence or absence of APN configuration (register 2306), device seed values (registers 768/769), and one LMU register value (1024,1: `3D` in File 1 vs. `45` in File 2). There is no document explaining what these differences mean operationally or why a generic "CI" script exists alongside a customer-specific Boaroo/Telstra script. An operator cannot determine from the repository alone whether the two scripts produce meaningfully different device behaviour or are effectively equivalent with minor operational differences.

**Fix:** Add per-script purpose documentation (as recommended in A04-1) that explicitly states, for each script: the intended device population, the key behavioural parameters configured, and how this script differs from related variants. A diff-based changelog or a variant comparison table in the "registers" document would satisfy this requirement.

---

**[A04-9]** — INFO: No pass3 output directory README or index exists to orient a reader of the audit artefacts

**Description:** This is an observation about the audit artefact structure rather than the scripts themselves. The `Aus Script/` directory has no index file explaining which subdirectory corresponds to which customer, what the version series mean, or how the scripts relate to each other. A new engineer or auditor approaching this directory cold has no entry point beyond the README at repository root.

**Fix:** Create a brief `Aus Script/README.md` (or equivalent index file) that lists each customer subdirectory, the customer it represents, the scripts it contains, the SIM carrier(s) covered, and a one-line description of the deployment context. This is a low-effort addition that substantially reduces onboarding friction.
