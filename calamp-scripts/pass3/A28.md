## Scope Confirmation

Pass 1 output (A28.md) confirms the following three files:

- `US Script/Matthai/61.137 Rayven and CI clone Matthai DataMono.csv`
- `US Script/Matthai/61.138 Rayven Matthai DataMono.csv`
- `US Script/Matthai/61.139 Rayven Mathhai Kore.csv`

These are all files present in the `US Script/Matthai/` subdirectory. No other files exist in that directory.

## Reading Evidence

### FILE: `US Script/Matthai/61.137 Rayven and CI clone Matthai DataMono.csv`

**Filename decomposition:**
- `61.137` — numeric prefix, format is `<major>.<minor>` (purpose unclear without documentation; not a conventional semantic version)
- `Rayven` — platform name (Rayven IoT platform)
- `and CI clone` — suggests this file was cloned from a CI (CalAmp Intelligent?) base script and then adapted
- `Matthai` — customer name (Matthai, a US industrial customer)
- `DataMono` — SIM carrier indicator (DataMono MVNO)
- No explicit country indicator in name; US context inferred from folder `US Script/`
- No date, author, or explicit version label in filename

**Row count:** 1230 rows (including 1 header row; 1229 data rows)

**Header row (row 1):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value` — structural schema header only; no description, no comment, no metadata

**Comment rows:** None. The CSV format used by CalAmp LMU Manager does not support comment rows; the file contains only the schema header and data rows.

**Unique parameter IDs present (count and list):**
Total unique parameter IDs: 63
IDs: 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 283, 285, 286, 291, 512, 513, 515, 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 779, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 913, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1037, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1056, 1280, 1281, 1282, 1283, 1536, 1537, 1538, 1539, 1540, 2178, 2306, 2307, 2312, 2313, 2318, 2319, 2327, 3072, 3073, 3074, 3328, 3329, 3330, 3331, 3332, 3333

**Key parameters of note (documentation lens):**
- 2319,0 = server hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (hex-encoded)
- 2319,1 = server IP `52.164.241.179` (hex-encoded)
- 2306,0 and 2306,1 = APN `data.mono`
- 3331,0 = `*****` (placeholder)
- 2318,0 = `*22899` (USSD string)
- 2178,0 = `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` (binary tag structure)
- Parameter IDs have no inline labels, descriptions, or units anywhere in the file

**Register documentation in file:** None. No register name or description appears anywhere in the CSV. All meaning is encoded in numeric IDs.

---

### FILE: `US Script/Matthai/61.138 Rayven Matthai DataMono.csv`

**Filename decomposition:**
- `61.138` — numeric prefix, minor version incremented from 61.137
- `Rayven` — platform name
- `Matthai` — customer name
- `DataMono` — SIM carrier
- No country indicator, no date, no author, no explicit version label
- Relationship to 61.137 is not documented anywhere (is this a later version? a different device batch? a simplified version without the CI clone base?)

**Row count:** 1229 rows (including 1 header row; 1228 data rows)

**Header row (row 1):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value` — structural schema header only

**Comment rows:** None.

**Key differences from 61.137 (documentation lens):**
- 2319 has only one entry (index 0 = IP `52.164.241.179`); the hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` present in 61.137 at index 0 is absent
- 768,0 value differs: 61.137 has `6704EB0F`, 61.138 has `34A4F1B3`
- 769,0 differs: 61.137 has `2AF8`, 61.138 has `05DE`
- 1024,23 differs: 61.137 has `89`, 61.138 has `8A`
- These differences are not explained anywhere; there is no changelog, diff note, or variant rationale

**Unique parameter IDs present:** Same set as 61.137 minus the second 2319 index entry. No new IDs introduced.

**Register documentation in file:** None.

---

### FILE: `US Script/Matthai/61.139 Rayven Mathhai Kore.csv`

**Filename decomposition:**
- `61.139` — numeric prefix, minor version incremented from 61.138
- `Rayven` — platform name
- `Mathhai` — note: this is a **typo** of the customer name; 61.137 and 61.138 spell it `Matthai`, this file spells it `Mathhai` (transposed letters)
- `Kore` — SIM carrier (Kore Wireless, a US IoT MVNO, different from DataMono in the other two files)
- No country indicator, no date, no author, no explicit version label

**Row count:** 1229 rows (including 1 header row; 1228 data rows)

**Header row (row 1):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value` — structural schema header only

**Comment rows:** None.

**Key differences from 61.137/61.138 (documentation lens):**
- 2306 (APN name) is absent; Kore carrier uses a different provisioning path
- 2308,0 = `Kore` (carrier name register, present only in this file)
- 2309,0 = `Kore123` (credential-like value, present only in this file; absent from the DataMono variants)
- 768,0 value = `34A4F1B3` (same as 61.138, different from 61.137's `6704EB0F`)
- 1024,1 = `3D` here vs `3E` in 61.137 and `3E` in 61.138
- 1024,23 = `8B` here vs `89` (61.137) and `8A` (61.138)
- These per-register differences between the three files are not explained anywhere

**Unique parameter IDs:** Same base set as 61.138 but with 2306 absent and 2308 and 2309 added.

**Register documentation in file:** None.

## Repository-Level Documentation Review

**README.md** (repo root) content summary:
- States the repo contains "scripts created for the Rayven CI transfer"
- Mentions scripts are divided by country and SIM type is indicated in the filename
- Instructs users to open files in LMU Manager
- Mentions new scripts need a "different version name" and should be "registered in the registers" — the word "registers" here is ambiguous (a spreadsheet? a Confluence page? a physical register?)
- Names one contact person (Rhythm Duwadi)
- Does not link to any parameter ID reference, CalAmp LMU documentation, or customer-specific requirements
- Does not explain the numeric prefix scheme (61.xxx, 62.xxx, 63.xxx, 69.xxx)
- Does not describe what distinguishes US Script from other script directories
- Does not describe what DataMono, Kore, PAPE, SIE, or other keywords in filenames mean
- Does not list which customers are served
- Does not describe the Matthai customer's specific fleet or tracking requirements

**External register documentation:** No parameter ID reference document was found anywhere in the repository. There is no data dictionary, no CalAmp LMU register map, no spreadsheet, and no Confluence or wiki link.

**Version tracking:** No CHANGELOG, no git tags, no version metadata inside any CSV file. Version is only implied by the numeric prefix in the filename, and what that prefix represents is not explained.

## Findings

**[A28-1]** — HIGH: No parameter ID documentation exists anywhere in the repository

**Description:** All three Matthai CSV files contain 90+ unique parameter IDs (e.g., 256, 512, 768, 2178, 2306, 2307, 2308, 2309, 2312, 2318, 2319, 2327, 3072, 3073, 3074, 3328, 3330, 3331, 3332, 3333, and many others). None of these IDs are documented inside the CSV files or anywhere else in the repository. There is no data dictionary, no CalAmp LMU register map, and no inline comments. A person reading these files cannot determine what any register controls without access to the proprietary CalAmp LMU Manager documentation or prior institutional knowledge. This creates a critical operational risk: engineers who maintain or deploy these scripts cannot verify the correctness of values without consulting external, undocumented sources. It also creates a security risk: sensitive registers (such as 2309 carrying `Kore123`, or 3331 carrying `*****`) cannot be identified as credential fields by anyone who does not already know their purpose.

**Fix:** Create and commit a register reference document (e.g., `docs/register-reference.md` or a companion CSV `docs/register-map.csv`) that lists each parameter ID used across the US scripts, its human-readable name, its data type, its units or encoding (e.g., hex string = null-terminated ASCII), and whether it contains sensitive data. At minimum, annotate the critical security-relevant registers (2178, 2306, 2307, 2308, 2309, 2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, 2318, 2319, 3331) with their purpose in the README or a supplementary document. Link to the CalAmp LMU documentation if it is available.

---

**[A28-2]** — HIGH: No inline documentation exists in any of the three CSV files

**Description:** Each of the three Matthai files begins with a structural header (`parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`) and then immediately lists data rows. There are no comment rows, no metadata rows, no descriptive preamble, and no annotated sections. The CSV format used by CalAmp LMU Manager does not natively support comment rows, but nothing prevents the operator from adding a companion sidecar file (e.g., a `.txt` or `.md` file alongside each CSV) that describes the script's purpose, the device model it targets, the carrier it is configured for, the customer it serves, and any non-obvious configuration choices. None of these companion files exist. The result is that anyone who opens these files — including the engineer who created them — cannot determine from the file alone what the script does, why specific values were chosen, or what customer requirement drove those choices.

**Fix:** For each CSV script, create a companion documentation sidecar file (e.g., `61.137 Rayven and CI clone Matthai DataMono.txt`) stored in the same directory, containing at minimum: (1) customer name and brief description of the customer's fleet, (2) target device model (CalAmp LMU model), (3) SIM carrier and APN used, (4) server endpoint the device reports to, (5) description of the reporting profile (intervals, triggers), (6) what makes this script different from the base or from other variants, (7) creation date and author, (8) last-modified date and reason for modification. Alternatively, adopt a structured YAML or JSON header file convention for the entire repository.

---

**[A28-3]** — MEDIUM: Filename versioning scheme is opaque and inconsistent

**Description:** The three files use numeric prefixes `61.137`, `61.138`, and `61.139`. The README states that new scripts should have "a different version name" but does not explain what `61.137` means. It is not a standard semantic version (no major.minor.patch), it does not correspond to a date, and the relationship between the major component (`61`) and the minor component (`137`, `138`, `139`) is unexplained. Additionally, `61.139` contains a misspelling of the customer name (`Mathhai` instead of `Matthai`), which would cause the file to sort separately from the other two files in case-sensitive contexts and makes it harder to identify as belonging to the same customer batch. Furthermore, `61.137` is described as "Rayven and CI clone Matthai DataMono" — the phrase "CI clone" is not explained. It is unclear whether "CI" means CalAmp Intelligent, a configuration index, or something else, and why only this file carries that label while 61.138 (which appears to be a simplified version of the same script) does not.

**Fix:** (1) Document the version numbering scheme in the README. Explain what `61` and `137/138/139` each represent (e.g., device firmware target, customer batch ID, sequential script number). (2) Correct the typo `Mathhai` to `Matthai` in `61.139 Rayven Mathhai Kore.csv` and update any references. (3) Define and document the convention for variant labels such as "CI clone" so future scripts use consistent terminology. (4) Consider adopting a naming convention that includes the country code explicitly (e.g., `US-61.137-Matthai-DataMono.csv`) since the current names omit the country designation that the README claims is present.

---

**[A28-4]** — MEDIUM: The relationship and differences between the three Matthai script variants are not documented

**Description:** Three scripts exist for the same customer (Matthai): 61.137, 61.138, and 61.139. They differ in at least the following documented ways:
- 61.137 uses both a hostname and an IP for the server (two entries in register 2319); 61.138 uses only the IP
- 61.137 and 61.138 use DataMono APN (register 2306); 61.139 uses Kore carrier (registers 2308 and 2309, no 2306)
- Multiple per-register values differ between files (768,0 — device configuration flags, 769,0 — timing parameter, 1024,1, 1024,23 — modem configuration bytes)
There is no changelog, no variant comparison table, no commit message explaining why 61.138 dropped the hostname entry, and no document explaining whether these scripts are deployed to different device populations, different fleets, or different geographic sites within the Matthai account. An operator tasked with deploying a new device for Matthai has no documented basis for choosing which script to use.

**Fix:** Create a variant comparison document or table (inline in a sidecar README or in a `docs/` file) that explains: (1) the intended use case or device population for each variant, (2) the carrier/SIM type each variant supports, (3) the key register differences and the business or technical reason for each difference, (4) which variant is current/preferred for new deployments. At minimum, the git commit messages for future changes should explain what changed and why.

---

**[A28-5]** — MEDIUM: Country identifier is missing from filenames despite README claiming country is documented in names

**Description:** The README states: "Currently these have been divided based on country with where the script sends data to mentioned on the name along with the type of SIM the script is for." However, none of the three Matthai filenames contain a country identifier. The files are stored in a `US Script/Matthai/` subdirectory, and the US context can only be inferred from the directory path — not from the filename itself. If a file is copied, moved, or referenced in isolation (e.g., in a deployment tool, an email attachment, or a different directory), the country context is lost entirely. The README's stated naming convention is not followed for these files.

**Fix:** Add a country code to the filename (e.g., `US-61.137 Rayven and CI clone Matthai DataMono.csv`) or update the README to reflect the actual convention (that country is indicated by directory path rather than filename). Whichever convention is adopted, apply it consistently across all files in the repository. Document the convention explicitly in the README.

---

**[A28-6]** — MEDIUM: Purpose of register 3331 (value `*****`) is undocumented and ambiguous across all three files

**Description:** All three Matthai files contain `3331,0,2A2A2A2A2A00`, which decodes to the ASCII string `*****`. Register 3331 appears in every Matthai file but its purpose is not documented anywhere in the repository. The value `*****` could represent: (a) a masked credential that was redacted before committing, (b) a literal five-asterisk default value that means "not configured", or (c) a placeholder to be substituted at provisioning time. The distinction matters significantly for security: if this is a masked credential, the actual value may have been committed in an earlier git commit and may still exist in git history. The README does not mention this register. No sidecar documentation explains it. No other file in the repository clarifies it.

**Fix:** Document register 3331 in the register reference document (see A28-1). Specifically: (1) state what this register controls, (2) confirm whether `*****` is a literal device value or a placeholder, (3) if it is a placeholder, document how and when it is substituted, (4) audit git history to determine whether a real credential value was ever committed to this register in any file and take appropriate action (see Pass 1 finding A28-3 for related context).

---

**[A28-7]** — MEDIUM: Purpose of register 2178 binary tag value is undocumented in all three files

**Description:** All three Matthai files contain `2178,0,3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00`, which decodes to the ASCII string `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`. This appears to be a structured tag or template expression embedded as a parameter value. Its function is not documented anywhere in the repository. The tags `<EA>`, `<S0>`, `<=*>`, and `<T1>` are not explained. This value is identical across all three files, which suggests it is a base configuration element, but without documentation it is impossible to determine whether it is a reporting format template, a display label, a trigger expression, or something else. If this field can be used to inject or modify device behavior, its consistent use across all scripts without documentation represents an undocumented attack surface.

**Fix:** Document register 2178 in the register reference document (see A28-1). Explain the tag syntax (`<EA>`, `<S0>`, `<=*>`, `<T1>`), what the assembled expression does on the device, and whether the value is user-controlled or fixed by the CalAmp firmware. If it is a template that is interpreted by the device at runtime, document the full syntax and any security implications of modifying it.

---

**[A28-8]** — LOW: The README does not link to CalAmp LMU documentation or parameter reference

**Description:** The README references the CalAmp LMU Manager as the tool for opening and editing scripts, and mentions that users can get it from the "CALAMP developer portal". However, it does not link to the portal URL, to any CalAmp technical documentation, to the LMU parameter register specification, or to any CalAmp support contact. Engineers who are new to this system have no documented starting point for understanding what the parameter IDs mean. This is compounded by the absence of an internal register reference (A28-1).

**Fix:** Add to the README: (1) a URL to the CalAmp developer portal, (2) a link to the LMU parameter register documentation (if publicly available or if an internal copy exists), (3) a note on which LMU device models these scripts target, (4) any CalAmp support or partner contact information relevant to this deployment.

---

**[A28-9]** — LOW: No author, creation date, or modification history is recorded in any file or its metadata

**Description:** None of the three CSV files contain any author attribution, creation date, last-modified date, or modification reason. The README identifies Rhythm Duwadi as the contact for new scripts but does not record who created each existing script or when. Git history provides some version tracking (commit timestamps and commit messages), but the commit messages in this repository are sparse (e.g., "Do it", "Files added for PAPE with Rayven in index 0") and do not provide meaningful change rationale. Without this information, it is not possible to determine when a script was last reviewed, whether it is current, or who is responsible for its accuracy.

**Fix:** Establish a convention for recording authorship and change history. Options include: (1) adding a mandatory sidecar file (see A28-2) that includes author and date fields, (2) adopting a structured git commit message format that records what changed and why (e.g., conventional commits), (3) maintaining a `CHANGELOG.md` in the `US Script/Matthai/` directory. Whichever approach is chosen, back-fill the existing files with best-available information (creation author, approximate creation date, purpose).

---

**[A28-10]** — LOW: Customer requirements for Matthai are not documented anywhere in the repository

**Description:** Matthai is a named customer with at least three script variants. The scripts encode specific reporting intervals, carrier preferences, server endpoints, and hardware configuration choices that presumably reflect Matthai's operational requirements. None of these requirements are documented. For example: Why does Matthai use both DataMono and Kore SIM variants? What fleet does Matthai operate? What reporting frequency does Matthai require and why? What triggered the creation of 61.139 (Kore) in addition to the DataMono variants? Without this context, there is no basis for validating whether the current scripts correctly implement Matthai's requirements, and no basis for maintaining them if the contact engineer (Rhythm Duwadi, per the README) is unavailable.

**Fix:** Create a brief customer configuration record for Matthai (in `docs/customers/Matthai.md` or equivalent) that documents: (1) Matthai's business context and fleet type, (2) the agreed reporting profile (intervals, geofence triggers, etc.), (3) the SIM/carrier arrangements in use (DataMono and Kore accounts), (4) the server endpoint(s) Matthai's data is sent to, (5) any customer-specific requirements that drove non-standard configuration choices, (6) the point of contact at Matthai.
