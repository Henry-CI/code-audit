## Reading Evidence

### FILE 1: `US Script/PAPE/62.371 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv`

**Line 1 (header row):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`

**Comment rows:** None. No `#`-prefixed lines, no descriptive rows, no embedded annotations beyond the structural CSV header.

**Row count:** 1238 lines total (1 header + 1237 data rows).

**Unique parameter IDs present (in order of first appearance):**
256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 283, 285, 286, 291, 512, 513, 515, 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 779, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 913, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1037, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1056, 1280, 1281, 1282, 1283, 1536, 1537, 1538, 1539, 1540, 2178, 2306, 2307, 2308, 2309, 2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, 2316, 2318, 2319, 2327, 3072, 3073, 3074, 3328, 3329, 3330, 3331, 3332, 3333

**Total unique parameter IDs:** 98

**Key documentation-relevant rows:**
- Row 1: `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value` — structural header only
- Row 989 (`1024,1,3E`): internal version byte = 0x3E = 62 decimal; aligns with filename version "62"
- Row 1095 (`2306,0,...`): APN = `data641003` (Kore MVNO)
- Row 1098 (`2308,0,...`): carrier = `Kore`
- Row 1109 (`2319,0,...`): server IP = `52.164.241.179`
- Row 1235 (`3331,0,...`): value = `*****`

**Version information embedded in content:** Register 1024,1 = `0x3E` = 62 decimal. This numeric value matches the major version component of the filename (62.371), providing implicit version tracing within the CSV content itself.

---

### FILE 2: `US Script/PAPE/63.137 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv`

**Line 1 (header row):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`

**Comment rows:** None.

**Row count:** 1238 lines total (1 header + 1237 data rows). Identical structure to 62.371.

**Unique parameter IDs present:** Identical set of 98 parameter IDs as 62.371.

**Key documentation-relevant rows:**
- Row 989 (`1024,1,3F`): internal version byte = 0x3F = 63 decimal; aligns with filename version "63"
- All other key rows (2306, 2308, 2309, 2319, 3331) are byte-for-byte identical to 62.371

**Version information embedded in content:** Register 1024,1 = `0x3F` = 63 decimal. Matches the major version component of the filename (63.137). Only one data row differs between this file and 62.371.

**Diff summary vs 62.371:** Single row difference — `1024,1` changed from `3E` to `3F`. All other 1236 data rows are identical.

---

### FILE 3: `US Script/PAPE/69.007 Final POD SIMcard.csv`

**Line 1 (header row):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`

**Comment rows:** None.

**Row count:** 1242 lines total (1 header + 1241 data rows). Four additional data rows compared to 62.371 and 63.137.

**Unique parameter IDs present:** All 98 IDs from 62.371/63.137 plus four additional: 2310, 2311, 2320, 2322.

**Total unique parameter IDs:** 102

**Additional rows vs 62.371/63.137:**

| Row (approx) | Register | Value | Decoded |
|--------------|----------|-------|---------|
| 1100 | 2310,0 | `00000000` | New register, value zero |
| 1101 | 2311,0 | `5014` | Port 20500 decimal |
| 1112 | 2320,0 | `646D2E63616C616D702E636F6D00` | `dm.calamp.com` (secondary server) |
| 1113 | 2322,0 | `00015180` | 86400 decimal (24-hour interval) |

**Changed rows vs 62.371:**

| Register | 62.371 value | 69.007 value | Meaning |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 1024,1   | `3E` (62)   | `45` (69)   | Version byte = 69; matches filename |
| 1024,23  | `89`        | `07`        | Internal modem/firmware config byte changed |

**Version information embedded in content:** Register 1024,1 = `0x45` = 69 decimal. Matches major version component of filename (69.007).

**Filename anomaly:** Unlike the other two files, `69.007 Final POD SIMcard.csv` does not include "Rayven" or "PAPE" in the filename despite being stored in the `PAPE/` subdirectory and sharing the same customer configuration.

## Repository-Level Documentation Check

**README.md** (`C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/README.md`) exists and states:
- The repo contains scripts for the "Rayven CI transfer"
- Scripts are "divided based on country with where the script sends data to mentioned on the name along with the type of SIM the script is for"
- New scripts require a "different version name" and must be "registered in the 'registers'"
- Contact: Rhythm Duwadi

**What the README does NOT provide:**
- No definition of what "Rayven", "CI", "PAPE", "Pod", "Datamono", or "SIMcard" mean
- No mapping of parameter IDs to human-readable register names or functions
- No changelog or version history
- No description of what any individual script does differently from others
- No SIM carrier identification guidance or APN documentation
- No country field for this batch (all PAPE files appear to be US-targeted based on the `US Script/` directory path, but no country is stated in the README or filenames)

**No other documentation files exist** at the `PAPE/` subdirectory level or adjacent to the CSV files.

## Findings

**[A34-1]** — HIGH: No inline documentation in any file — parameter IDs are entirely undocumented within the CSV

**Description:** All three files contain zero comment rows and zero annotation rows. The sole non-data line in each file is the structural CSV header `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`. The 98 to 102 unique parameter IDs present in these scripts (e.g., 256, 512, 769, 1024, 2178, 2306, 2309, 2319, 3330, 3331) carry no documentation of any kind within the file itself. A reader must either already know the CalAmp LMU register map by memory or consult an external reference (which is not linked, named, or included in this repository) to understand what any given row configures. This is a structural documentation failure applicable to every CSV in this batch. The README.md vaguely references "the 'registers'" but does not identify what document or system that refers to, and no register reference document is present in the repository.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files.

**Fix:** One of the following remediation approaches should be adopted:

Option A (preferred): Add a fourth column `parameter_description` to each CSV file populated with human-readable register names (e.g., `2306 = APN name`, `2309 = network credential`, `2319 = primary server IP`). This is backward compatible if the LMU Manager tool ignores extra columns.

Option B: Maintain a companion register reference document (e.g., `US Script/PAPE/REGISTER_MAP.md` or a repo-level `REGISTER_MAP.csv`) mapping every parameter ID used in PAPE scripts to its CalAmp documentation name, data type, and purpose. Link this document from the README.

Option C: Add a file-level comment block as a specially-prefixed set of rows at the top of each CSV (e.g., `#,0,Customer: PAPE` / `#,1,Carrier: Kore` / `#,2,Purpose: Pod tracker configuration`) if the LMU Manager supports comment lines.

---

**[A34-2]** — HIGH: `69.007 Final POD SIMcard.csv` filename omits the customer name (PAPE), breaking the naming convention used by all other files in the directory

**Description:** Every other file in the `US Script/PAPE/` directory includes "PAPE" in its filename: `62.134 Rayven CI PAPE Final Datamono.csv`, `62.137 Rayven CI PAPE Final Pod.csv`, `62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv`, `62.371 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv`, `63.137 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv`. By contrast, `69.007 Final POD SIMcard.csv` omits both "Rayven" and "PAPE". Additionally, the "PAPE" customer name is absent from the filename entirely. Without reading the file content and matching it by APN (`data641003`) and server IP (`52.164.241.179`) against the other PAPE scripts, there is no way to determine from the filename alone that this file belongs to the PAPE customer. The filename also omits the "Rayven" platform indicator included in all other PAPE filenames. A technician selecting scripts by filename for deployment could easily misattribute this file to a different customer.

**Files affected:** `69.007 Final POD SIMcard.csv`

**Fix:** Rename the file to follow the established convention, for example: `69.007 Rayven PAPE Final POD SIMcard.csv`. Apply a git mv to preserve history. Update any deployment tooling or documentation that references the old filename.

---

**[A34-3]** — MEDIUM: No SIM carrier is identified in any filename in this batch

**Description:** The README states that scripts have "where the script sends data to mentioned on the name along with the type of SIM the script is for." In practice, the PAPE filenames do not identify the SIM carrier. The carrier for all three files is Kore Wireless, using APN `data641003`, but this information appears only in the encoded register values (2306 = APN, 2308 = carrier name `Kore`) within the CSV body — it is entirely absent from filenames. Other scripts in the wider repository do include carrier identifiers in filenames (e.g., `61.139 Rayven Mathhai Kore.csv` includes "Kore" in the name). The PAPE files in this batch do not follow that convention despite using the same carrier. This means the filename does not satisfy the documented naming requirement.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files.

**Fix:** Add the carrier identifier to the filename per the README convention. For the Kore carrier, the suffix "Kore" should be appended, consistent with other scripts in the repository. Example corrected names: `62.371 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed Kore.csv`, `63.137 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed Kore.csv`, `69.007 Rayven PAPE Final POD SIMcard Kore.csv`.

---

**[A34-4]** — MEDIUM: No country identifier appears in any filename or within any file content in this batch

**Description:** The README states scripts are "divided based on country." The top-level directory structure is `US Script/`, which places these files in the US category. However, the country identifier "US" does not appear in any filename in this batch. If scripts are ever reorganized or moved out of their directory, or if the directory structure changes, there is no country indicator preserved in the filenames themselves. Additionally, the CSV content contains no comment or field that identifies the target country. This is a documentation gap relative to the README's stated naming intent.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files.

**Fix:** Add a country identifier to each filename, for example `62.371 Rayven PAPE US Final Pod Fixed.csv`, consistent with how the README describes the naming convention. Alternatively, document explicitly that the directory path (`US Script/`) is the authoritative country indicator and that filenames do not need to duplicate it — but this policy should be written down in the README.

---

**[A34-5]** — MEDIUM: Script purpose terms "Pod", "Pod Fixed", and "POD SIMcard" are undefined and inconsistent

**Description:** The three files in this batch use the terms "Pod Fixed" (62.371, 63.137) and "POD SIMcard" (69.007) in their filenames to indicate script purpose/variant. Neither term is defined anywhere in the repository. "Pod" is capitalized inconsistently (sentence case vs. all-caps "POD"). The distinction between "Pod Fixed" and "POD SIMcard" is significant from a configuration standpoint — as established in the Pass 1 analysis, the `69.007` file adds a secondary server (`dm.calamp.com`), an explicit port (20500), and a heartbeat interval register that are absent from the "Pod Fixed" variants — but none of this differentiation is documented anywhere accessible without reading and decoding the raw CSV. There is no glossary, no README annotation, and no comment rows that explain what "Pod" hardware type means, what "Fixed" indicates about the configuration, or what "SIMcard" suffix implies compared to the others.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files; the naming ambiguity is most acute for `69.007 Final POD SIMcard.csv`.

**Fix:** Add a `PAPE/README.md` or equivalent documentation file to the `US Script/PAPE/` directory that defines the purpose terms used in script filenames: what "Pod" hardware means, what "Fixed" indicates (presumably a corrected/finalized version), what "SIMcard" denotes (whether it refers to a different SIM type, SIM slot, or provisioning method), and what the numbered version components (e.g., 62.371, 69.007) refer to.

---

**[A34-6]** — MEDIUM: No changelog or deprecation notice distinguishes 62.371 from its successor 63.137

**Description:** Files `62.371 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv` and `63.137 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv` have identical filenames except for the leading version number, and their content is 99.9% identical (one byte difference in register 1024,1). There is no documentation anywhere — not in the README, not as a comment row, not in a changelog, not in a PAPE-specific documentation file — indicating which of these two files is the current authoritative version, whether 62.371 is deprecated, what change prompted the version bump from 62.x to 63.x, or when each version was created or deployed. A technician provisioning new devices cannot determine from documentation alone which version to use.

**Files affected:** `62.371 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv` and `63.137 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv`

**Fix:** Create a changelog entry (in a `PAPE/CHANGELOG.md` or inline in a `PAPE/README.md`) documenting the difference between 62.371 and 63.137 and explicitly stating which is current. If 62.371 is superseded by 63.137 and no longer deployed, mark it as deprecated in a comment and consider moving it to an `archive/` subfolder to prevent accidental use.

---

**[A34-7]** — LOW: Version numbering scheme is not documented and the numeric format is ambiguous

**Description:** Script filenames use a version number format of `NN.NNN` (e.g., `62.371`, `63.137`, `69.007`). The README says new scripts need "a different version name" but does not explain this format. It is not documented whether the number before the decimal is a major version, a device firmware target version, an internal build number, or something else. The number after the decimal is also unexplained — it is not obvious whether `371` and `137` represent minor versions, build dates, variant codes, or arbitrary identifiers. From the Pass 1 analysis, the major version component (62, 63, 69) correlates with register 1024,1 (the internal version byte), providing implicit alignment between filename and content — but this relationship is not documented anywhere. A technician or new team member must reverse-engineer the versioning scheme from the file content.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files (batch-wide issue).

**Fix:** Document the version number format in the README or a dedicated PAPE documentation file. Specifically: (1) define what the major version component represents and how it maps to register 1024,1; (2) define what the minor version component represents; (3) specify the version increment policy (when to bump major vs. minor).

---

**[A34-8]** — LOW: The README's "registers" reference is unresolved — no register reference document exists in the repository

**Description:** The README states "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be registered in the 'registers'." This is the only reference to a register documentation source in the entire repository. The phrase "registered in the 'registers'" is ambiguous — it could mean: (a) a spreadsheet or document called "registers" somewhere outside this repository; (b) the CalAmp LMU Manager software's internal register database; or (c) something else. No file matching "register", "registers", "LMU register map", or similar exists anywhere in the repository. This leaves the repository with a dangling documentation reference: the README acknowledges that parameter documentation exists but does not make it accessible, link to it, or reproduce the relevant portions.

**Files affected:** Repository-wide; directly impacts all CSV files in this batch since all 98–102 parameter IDs they use are undocumented within the repository.

**Fix:** Either (a) include the CalAmp LMU register reference (or the subset relevant to PAPE scripts) as a committed file in the repository, or (b) update the README to provide a specific, stable URL or document title for the external register reference. The contact person named in the README (Rhythm Duwadi) should be responsible for populating this reference.

---

**[A34-9]** — INFO: The structural CSV header `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value` is the only documentation present inside the files

**Description:** All three files begin with a valid, consistent CSV header row. This header accurately describes the three-column structure of the data and provides the minimum necessary documentation to parse the file format programmatically. This is a positive finding and the only documentation present within the file bodies themselves. It is noted here so that the complete picture of inline documentation is clear: the header row exists and is consistent across all three files.

**Files affected:** All three assigned files.

**Fix:** No action required on the header row itself. Its presence is correct and should be maintained in any future scripts.
