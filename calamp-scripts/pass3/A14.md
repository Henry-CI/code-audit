## Scope Clarification

The glob `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/8bit Script/*.csv` returns exactly two files. Both files share the same base filename with the second being a parenthesized copy `(1)`. Alphabetically sorted, the "second batch" encompasses both files, as the total set is only two:

1. `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10.csv`
2. `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10 (1).csv`

Both files are covered here. They are byte-for-byte identical (confirmed via content comparison in Python).

### Filename Decomposition Analysis

Filename: `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10`

| Token | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| `50.131` | Version/variant number (50 = country/region prefix; .131 = script revision) |
| `RHM` | Likely operator/author initials — matches "Rhythm Duwadi" (RHM = Rhythm) |
| `8bit` | Firmware architecture: 8-bit CalAmp LMU firmware (vs. 32-bit or Linux variant) |
| `LMU1220` | CalAmp device model: LMU-1220 |
| `POD` | Unknown abbreviation — possibly "Proof of Delivery" or an internal project code |
| `10minSleep6hr` | Behaviour descriptor: 10-minute sleep interval, 6-hour cycle |
| `Input1POS` | Behaviour: Input 1 triggers a position report |
| `PwrMonEvt` | Behaviour: Power Monitor Event enabled |
| `PEG0MotionEvt` | Behaviour: PEG (Programmable Event Generator) index 0, motion event |
| `Acc4` | Behaviour: Accelerometer sensitivity threshold (4 units) |
| `Dist500` | Behaviour: Distance filter 500 metres |
| `Thes10` | Behaviour: Threshold value of 10 (unit/context unspecified in filename) |

**What is absent from the filename:**
- No customer name
- No country identifier (the `50.` prefix is used for Australian scripts elsewhere in the repo but this is not documented)
- No SIM carrier / APN carrier (file uses APN `data641003` — carrier not named in filename)
- No explicit purpose summary beyond encoded behaviour flags

### Repository-Level Documentation Audit

**README.md:** Present at repository root. States:
- "These have been divided based on country with where the script sends data to mentioned on the name along with the type of SIM the script is for."
- "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'"
- No definition of what "8bit" means
- No definition of the naming convention tokens (prefix numbers, suffixes, etc.)
- No register/parameter ID documentation in the README itself
- References "registers" as a place to record new scripts — this appears to mean the `URL & PORTS.xlsx` file or a similar tracking sheet, but the README does not point to a specific file

**ConfigParams.xml** (in `CALAMP APPS/LMUToolbox_V41/`): This file is a machine-generated CalAmp LMU Manager parameter reference in XML spreadsheet format. It documents all parameter IDs by name, decimal ID, hex ID, 8-bit max index, 32-bit max index, type, and usage notes. It confirms the `8-bit Max Index` column distinguishes the maximum index count for 8-bit firmware from 32-bit firmware. This file is the closest thing to a register reference in the repository. However:
- It is a vendor tool asset, not a human-authored register guide
- It is not referenced by name in the README
- It is not cross-linked from any CSV file
- Its presence in the repo is not explained to a new user

**URL & PORTS.xlsx:** Present at repository root. This is a binary Excel file. Its content was not readable as plaintext. Based on context and the README reference to "where the script sends data to mentioned on the name," it likely documents server endpoints and ports. No documentation of the 8bit/32bit distinction is expected there.

**No changelog, no schema documentation, no inline comments in any CSV file.**

## Findings

**[A14-1]** — HIGH: Both 8bit CSV files are byte-for-byte duplicates with no differentiation

**Description:** The two files in `8bit Script/` are exactly identical in every byte of content. The only difference is the filename suffix `(1)` appended to the second file. Both were committed in the same commit (`678d0d4`). This indicates the second file is an unintentional duplicate — a filesystem copy artefact (e.g., Windows "Copy of" or drag-copy operation) that was added to version control without review. A reader of the repository has no way to know whether the files are intentionally different variants or accidental duplicates. If one file were edited going forward (e.g., to update a server URL or APN), the other would silently diverge and potentially be applied to devices producing inconsistent configurations. The presence of a meaningless `(1)` duplicate in the repository also undermines confidence that other scripts are managed with appropriate version control discipline.

**Fix:** Delete the `(1)` duplicate file from the repository and from git history. If a second variant of this script is genuinely needed (e.g., for a different customer or APN profile), create it with a distinct, meaningful filename that encodes the distinguishing characteristic. Document the script lineage in the commit message or in the README.

---

**[A14-2]** — HIGH: No customer name in filename — script purpose and ownership are undocumented

**Description:** The filename `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10` does not identify any customer, organisation, or deployment context. The README states scripts are "divided based on country with where the script sends data to mentioned on the name along with the type of SIM the script is for," but this file violates all three parts of that convention: the country is only implied by the `50.` prefix (which is not documented), the server destination (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) is not mentioned in the name, and the SIM/APN carrier is not mentioned. The APN decodes to `data641003`, which appears to be a data-only SIM APN but the carrier is not named. The token `POD` is undefined. An operator tasked with deploying this script to hardware has no reliable way to determine which customer fleet it belongs to, whether it is a production or test configuration, or which SIM cards it is designed for.

**Fix:** Rename the file to include the customer name (or a unique project code), the SIM carrier name, and a clear purpose indicator. Follow the naming convention used by other scripts in the repository, such as `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` (customer "Keller", purpose "Demo", APN condition "Blank APN"). Define and document the naming convention in the README.

---

**[A14-3]** — MEDIUM: The term "8bit" is not defined or documented anywhere in the repository

**Description:** The `8bit Script/` directory name and the `8bit` token in the filename refer to the CalAmp LMU 8-bit firmware variant, as opposed to the 32-bit or Linux firmware variants. This distinction is critical for correct device provisioning: applying an 8-bit configuration script to a 32-bit firmware device (or vice versa) can result in rejected parameters, silent misconfiguration, or device malfunction. However, nowhere in the repository — not the README, not any CSV file, not any commit message — is the term "8bit" explained, defined, or linked to any documentation. The `ConfigParams.xml` tool asset documents an "8-bit Max Index" column, confirming the architectural distinction exists, but this file is a CalAmp vendor asset and is not integrated into the project's own documentation. A new team member encountering the `8bit Script/` directory has no guidance on what hardware this applies to, why it is separated, or what constraints apply.

**Fix:** Add a section to the README explaining the firmware architecture distinction between 8-bit, 32-bit, and Linux CalAmp LMU variants, specifying which device models use each, and explaining why separate script directories exist for each firmware type. Alternatively, add a `README.txt` or similar file inside the `8bit Script/` directory explaining the constraint.

---

**[A14-4]** — MEDIUM: No inline documentation — CSV files contain no comments or header explanation

**Description:** Both CSV files contain only a single header row (`parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`) followed by 327 raw data rows of numeric IDs and hexadecimal values. There is no preamble, no comment syntax, no human-readable description of what the script does, what behaviour it configures, which device it targets, or what the intended operational outcome is. The CalAmp LMU Manager CSV format does not natively support comment rows, but a leading comment block as a non-numeric row or a companion `.txt` / `.md` sidecar file would serve the same purpose. As a result, the only documentation of a script's purpose is the filename itself — and as noted in A14-2, the filename for these files is incomplete.

**Fix:** Add a companion documentation file (e.g., `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10.md` or a shared `8bit Script/SCRIPTS.md`) for each script or script group, recording: customer name, device model, firmware variant, SIM carrier, intended deployment context, key configuration parameters in human-readable form (server, APN, sleep intervals, event triggers), author, and version history. At minimum, update the filename per A14-2 so the filename itself serves as sufficient documentation for routine operations.

---

**[A14-5]** — MEDIUM: Register documentation is not linked from or referenced by any script file

**Description:** The CalAmp parameter reference `CALAMP APPS/LMUToolbox_V41/ConfigParams.xml` provides authoritative documentation for all parameter IDs used in the CSV scripts (confirmed: all 55 parameter IDs in the 8bit scripts are present in this reference). However, this file is never referenced from the README, from any CSV file, or from any commit message. A reader encountering the CSV files in isolation has no guidance on where to look up the meaning of numeric IDs such as 512 (EVENT_RECORD_PAGE1), 2306 (GPRS_CONTEXT_STRING), or 2314 (PPP_USER_STRING). The README instructs that changes "should be register in the 'registers'" but does not specify what file the "registers" refers to, and does not mention ConfigParams.xml at all.

**Fix:** Update the README to explicitly name `CALAMP APPS/LMUToolbox_V41/ConfigParams.xml` as the parameter ID reference for all scripts in the repository. Add a sentence explaining the structure of the file (vendor-provided XML spreadsheet mapping decimal parameter IDs to names, types, and descriptions). Optionally add a short human-readable parameter cheat sheet in the README for the most commonly used registers (APN, server URL, port, event records).

---

**[A14-6]** — MEDIUM: Version/variant numbering is inconsistent and undocumented

**Description:** The filename prefix `50.131` follows a pattern seen across the repository (e.g., `50.131 LMU1220 units.csv` in `Aus Script/CEA/`, `50.132 LMU1220 Rayven.csv` in the same directory). The major number (`50`) appears to denote a country or regional category (Australian scripts also use `61.xxx` and `69.xxx`; US scripts use `62.xxx` and `63.xxx`; UK scripts use `161.xxx`). The minor number (`.131`) appears to be a script revision or sequence number. However, neither the README nor any file in the repository defines this versioning scheme. The `50.131` prefix is also shared with `50.131 LMU1220 units.csv` in the CEA subdirectory, suggesting the same version number was reused for a completely different customer and purpose — which breaks the assumption that the prefix uniquely identifies a script. The `8bit Script/` files do not use the same customer subdirectory structure used elsewhere in the repo, further obscuring their lineage.

**Fix:** Define and document the version numbering scheme (major.minor meaning, uniqueness constraints) in the README. Ensure that version numbers are not reused across different customers or purposes. If `50.131` is intended to identify a generic baseline configuration (not customer-specific), document that explicitly and distinguish it from customer-specific scripts.

---

**[A14-7]** — LOW: APN `data641003` carrier is not identified in filename or any documentation

**Description:** Register 2306 (GPRS_CONTEXT_STRING) in both files decodes to the APN string `data641003`. This APN is characteristic of Telstra's IoT/M2M data service (the `data641003` APN is a known Telstra Australia APN used for certain SIM products). However, the filename does not name Telstra as the carrier. The README states that "the type of SIM the script is for" should be in the name, but it is not. Other scripts in the repository that use Telstra explicitly include "Telstra" in their filenames (e.g., `69.003 RD CEA Telstra Final.csv`, `69.005 Rayven Boaroo Telstra Final.csv`). The inconsistency means the carrier information for the 8bit scripts is only recoverable by decoding the hex APN value, which requires knowledge of the hex encoding and carrier APN lists.

**Fix:** Rename the file to include the carrier name (e.g., insert `Telstra` after `8bit`), consistent with the naming convention used in other script directories. Confirm the carrier identity with the APN owner if there is any uncertainty about whether `data641003` is a Telstra APN in this deployment context.

---

**[A14-8]** — LOW: Script purpose token "POD" is undefined

**Description:** The filename contains the token `POD` with no documentation of its meaning. In logistics and fleet management contexts, "POD" typically means "Proof of Delivery." It may also refer to a specific customer project, an internal deployment programme, or a hardware configuration variant. Without documentation, operators cannot determine whether a device that requires POD functionality should receive this script rather than another. The token appears in the filename between the device model (`LMU1220`) and the behaviour descriptors, suggesting it may be a deployment programme or project identifier rather than a technical parameter.

**Fix:** Add a comment block (sidecar file or README entry) that defines what "POD" means in this script context and which customer or deployment programme it refers to. If "POD" is not meaningful or was used as a placeholder, rename the file to remove it.

---

**[A14-9]** — INFO: ConfigParams.xml confirms 8-bit firmware has distinct max-index constraints vs. 32-bit

**Description:** The `ConfigParams.xml` register reference documents an "8-bit Max Index" column that is distinct from the "32-bit Max Index" column. For example:
- Register 2306 (APN): 8-bit max index = 2; 32-bit max index = 3
- Register 512 (EVENT_RECORD_PAGE1): 8-bit max index = 128 (config-v2) or 100; 32-bit max index = 250

The 8bit script files in this repository correctly stay within the 8-bit max index constraints (e.g., register 2306 uses indices 0 and 1 only; register 512 uses up to index 121). This confirms the "8bit" designation is technically meaningful and correctly applied. The information is noted here as context for future maintainers: using this script on a 32-bit device would not consume all available event record slots (512 indices), which may be a limitation or a deliberate conservative configuration.

**Fix:** No immediate fix required. Document this constraint in the script's companion documentation (per A14-4 recommendation) so maintainers understand the architectural reason for the index ceiling.
