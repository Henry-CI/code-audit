## Reading Evidence

### Files Enumerated

Glob of `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/CALAMP APPS/LMUToolbox_V41/*.xml` returned exactly three files:

1. `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/CALAMP APPS/LMUToolbox_V41/ConfigParams.xml`
2. `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/CALAMP APPS/LMUToolbox_V41/PEG List.xml`
3. `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/CALAMP APPS/LMUToolbox_V41/VBUS.xml`

No XSD schema files, README files, .txt files, or any other documentation files were found anywhere under `CALAMP APPS/`. A glob for `**/*.xsd`, `**/*.md`, and `**/*.txt` under that subtree returned no results.

### FILE: ConfigParams.xml

**Format:** Microsoft Office SpreadsheetML (XML Workbook, `progid="Excel.Sheet"`). Not a standalone XML configuration format — it is an Excel spreadsheet saved as XML.

**File-level metadata in `<DocumentProperties>`:**
- `<Author>Kevin Scully</Author>`
- `<LastAuthor>Kevin Scully</LastAuthor>`
- `<Created>2011-06-16T23:03:26Z</Created>`
- `<LastSaved>2020-10-31T11:38:38Z</LastSaved>`
- `<Version>40.00</Version>` — This is the Excel file format version, not the toolbox version.

**Internal spreadsheet header rows (rows 1–4 of the worksheet):**
- Row 1: Title cell — `"LMU Configuration Parameters"` (no purpose statement, no version number, no "last updated" date in any human-readable comment or header).
- Row 2: A `DateTime` value `2020-10-31T00:00:00.000` — a date stamp, no label explaining what it represents. It appears to record last-update date but has no column heading.
- Row 3: `"Newly added or changed configuration parameters are highlighted in yellow"` — a legend note, not a file-purpose description.
- Row 4 (legend): `"U=UnsignedDecimal, S=SignedDecimal, M=Masked, A=ASCII; |=Delimiter; IP=IPAddress, ST=String"` — a type-encoding key.

**Column headers (row 5 of the worksheet, the actual data header row):**
```
Name | ID-Dec | ID-Hex | 8-bit Max Index | 32-bit Max Index | Linux Max Index | Param Value Type | Notes/Usage | LMDecoder
```
Nine columns total.

**Parameter entry structure (representative rows examined):**
- `GPRS_CONTEXT_STRING` (ID 2306, hex 902): Param Value Type = `"64-char null term"`, Notes/Usage = *empty*.
- `PAP_USER_STRING` (ID 2308, hex 904): Param Value Type = `"16-char null term"`, Notes/Usage = `"<PPP-PAP Auth Username string>"`.
- `PAP_PWORD_STRING` (ID 2309, hex 905): Param Value Type = `"16-char null term"`, Notes/Usage = `"<PPP-PAP Auth Password string>"`.
- `MAINT_REMOTE_PORT` (ID 2311, hex 907): Param Value Type = `"16-bit unsigned "`, Notes/Usage = *empty*.
- `PPP_USER_STRING` (ID 2314, hex 90A): Param Value Type = `"64-char null term"`, Notes/Usage = `"<PPP-PAP/CHAP Auth Username string>"`.
- `PPP_PWORD_STRING` (ID 2315, hex 90B): Param Value Type = `"16-char null term"`, Notes/Usage = `"<PPP-PAP/CHAP Auth Password string>"`.
- `URL_INBOUND` (ID 2319, hex 90F): Param Value Type = `"64-char null term"`, Notes/Usage = `"<Inbound Server URL string>"`.
- `URL_MAINT` (ID 2320, hex 910): Param Value Type = `"64-char null term"`, Notes/Usage = `"<Maintenance Server URL string>"`.

**Observations on parameter documentation completeness:**
- The `Notes/Usage` column is the only free-text documentation field for each parameter, aside from the parameter name itself.
- For security-relevant registers 2306 (GPRS_CONTEXT_STRING) and 2311 (MAINT_REMOTE_PORT), the Notes/Usage cell is **empty**.
- For registers 2308, 2309, 2314, 2315, 2319, 2320, the Notes/Usage cell contains a short angle-bracket placeholder string (e.g., `<PPP-PAP Auth Username string>`) which is a format hint, not a full description.
- No field exists for: valid value ranges, units, minimum/maximum values, security classification, or deprecation status.
- The `Param Value Type` column contains only data-type size labels (e.g., `"16-char null term"`, `"32-bit unsigned"`) — not semantic descriptions of acceptable values.
- Total row count: 2,106 rows (ExpandedRowCount). No sampling of how many rows have empty Notes/Usage was possible at full scale, but spot-checking shows many rows (e.g., MAINT_REMOTE_PORT, GPRS_CONTEXT_STRING, COMM_INDEX, NULLMSG_INTERVAL) have empty Notes/Usage cells.

**Version documentation:**
- The directory name `LMUToolbox_V41` implies version 41. The `<Version>40.00</Version>` field in DocumentProperties records the Excel format version, not the toolbox version. No cell or comment in the spreadsheet explicitly states "LMU Toolbox Version 41". The toolbox version is documented only by the directory name.

---

### FILE: PEG List.xml

**Format:** Microsoft Office SpreadsheetML (XML Workbook). Four worksheets: "Triggers", "Conditions", "Actions", "Acc Types".

**File-level metadata in `<DocumentProperties>`:**
- `<Author>Kevin Scully</Author>` / `<LastAuthor>Kevin Scully</LastAuthor>`
- `<Created>2008-09-18T19:31:23Z</Created>` / `<LastSaved>2020-10-31T13:08:21Z</LastSaved>`
- `<Version>40.00</Version>`

**Internal spreadsheet header (Triggers worksheet, row 1):**
- Title cell: `"PEG Triggers, Conditions and Actions"` — identifies the document purpose.
- Platform compatibility columns present: `LMU-4100`, `LMU-1xxx`, `STM32`, `STM8S`, `LMU32`.

**Column headers (Triggers worksheet data header):**
```
TRIGGERS | Code | Short Name | Definition | [LMU-4100] | [LMU-1xxx] | [STM32] | [STM8S] | [LMU32]
```
The `Definition` column contains a short English sentence for each trigger (e.g., `"LMU powered-up"`, `"LMU Wakeup"`). The platform columns use `"y"` to indicate support.

**Observations:**
- Each entry has a short `Definition` text. Definitions are present and reasonably descriptive but are brief (typically one line).
- No "last updated" label visible in spreadsheet header rows (only metadata in DocumentProperties).
- No file-purpose comment beyond the title row.
- Version information absent from spreadsheet content; only in directory name.

### FILE: VBUS.xml

**Format:** Microsoft Office SpreadsheetML (XML Workbook). Single worksheet named "ConfigParams" (despite file name VBUS.xml — mismatch noted). Extremely large: 280,908 lines, 9,858 rows, 14 columns. Contains SAE J1939 CAN bus PGN/SPN parameter reference data.

**File-level metadata in `<DocumentProperties>`:**
- `<Author>Kevin Scully</Author>` / `<LastAuthor>kscully</LastAuthor>`
- `<Created>2011-06-16T23:03:26Z</Created>` / `<LastSaved>2020-10-31T11:02:13Z</LastSaved>`
- `<Version>40.00</Version>`

**Internal spreadsheet header rows:**
- Row 1: `"Vehicle Bus Parameters"` — purpose title.
- Row 2: `"1 November, 2016"` — an internal date label, but this is **inconsistent** with the DocumentProperties `<LastSaved>2020-10-31T11:02:13Z</LastSaved>`. The displayed date has not been updated to reflect the last-save date of October 2020.

**Column headers (row 4):**
```
PGN (0) | Name (1) | LEN (2) | Type (3) | Pos (4) | LEN (5) | SPN (6) | Name (7) | Notes (8) | Range (9) | ? (10) | Mult (11) | Offset (12) | UOM2 (13)
```

**Observations:**
- Column 10 is labeled `"? (10)"` — an unnamed column with no description of its purpose. This is documentation-quality deficiency within the reference data itself.
- Notes (8), Range (9), Mult (11), Offset (12), UOM2 (13) are well-populated across J1939 SPN entries (drawn from the SAE J1939 standard).
- The internal date label on row 2 (`"1 November, 2016"`) has not been updated despite the file being last saved on 2020-10-31, indicating the file was updated without updating its internal version/date header.
- Worksheet name `"ConfigParams"` does not match the file name `"VBUS.xml"`, creating a mismatch that could mislead a reader opening the file without context.

### XML Comments — All Three Files

No XML comment nodes (`<!-- ... -->`) exist in any of the three files. There are zero XML-native documentation comments in the entire LMUToolbox_V41 directory.

---

### Schema Documentation

No XSD schema file exists for any of the three XML files. No schema is referenced within any `<?xml-model?>` processing instruction, `xsi:schemaLocation` attribute, or any other schema-referencing mechanism. The only schema implied is the Microsoft Office SpreadsheetML namespace (`urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet`) which is a proprietary format schema, not a project-specific schema.

---

### Usage Documentation (XML-to-CSV Relationship)

The repository README.md (`C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/README.md`) states:
> "All the Scripts are in csv format so open any file you wish to edit using the LMU manager."
> "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'"

The README does not explain:
- What ConfigParams.xml is used for during CSV script creation or editing.
- What PEG List.xml or VBUS.xml are used for.
- How the XML files relate to the LMU Manager tool.
- How the parameter IDs in ConfigParams.xml correspond to the numeric register IDs in the CSV scripts.
- What the "registers" mentioned in the README refers to or how to update them.

Verification that CSV scripts use registers documented in ConfigParams.xml: confirmed. Sample CSV file `69.003 RD CEA Telstra Final.csv` uses registers 2308, 2309, 2319 — all present and at minimum minimally documented in ConfigParams.xml. Register 2306 (GPRS_CONTEXT_STRING) appears in the same CSV but has an empty Notes/Usage cell in ConfigParams.xml.

## Findings

**[A20-1]** — MEDIUM: No file-level header comments or purpose documentation in any XML file

**Description:** None of the three XML files (`ConfigParams.xml`, `PEG List.xml`, `VBUS.xml`) contain any XML comment nodes (`<!-- -->`). Zero XML-level documentation exists explaining each file's purpose, the toolbox version it covers, the LMU firmware revision it targets, or when it was last meaningfully updated. The only structural documentation is in spreadsheet header rows (rows 1–3 of each worksheet), which provide minimal title text. A developer encountering these files without prior context has no machine-readable or self-contained explanation of:
- What toolbox version these files serve.
- What LMU firmware version they correspond to.
- How these files interrelate (e.g., that VBUS.xml feeds into the same LMU Manager tool as ConfigParams.xml).
- Who is responsible for maintaining them and how updates should be submitted.

**Fix:** Add an XML processing comment block immediately after the `<?xml version="1.0"?>` declaration in each file, documenting: file purpose, toolbox version (V41), target LMU firmware version range, date of last meaningful content update, and the name of the responsible maintainer or team. Example format:
```xml
<!--
  File: ConfigParams.xml
  Purpose: LMU Toolbox V41 configuration parameter reference registry.
  Toolbox Version: 41
  Target Firmware: LMU-1xxx/LMU-4100/LMU32 firmware as of [version]
  Last Content Update: 2020-10-31
  Maintainer: CalAmp LMU Toolbox team
-->
```

---

**[A20-2]** — MEDIUM: Toolbox version documented only in directory name, not within any file

**Description:** The toolbox version "V41" is encoded solely in the directory name `LMUToolbox_V41`. None of the three XML files contain any internal record of this version number. The `<Version>40.00</Version>` element in `<DocumentProperties>` records the Microsoft Excel file format version, not the CalAmp LMU Toolbox version — these are unrelated values and could be misread. If these files are copied out of the directory structure (e.g., archived, emailed, or deployed to another location), the version information is lost. The `VBUS.xml` internal date label reads `"1 November, 2016"` but the file was last saved `2020-10-31`, confirming the internal version/date tracking is already out of synchronization.

**Fix:** Add an explicit toolbox version identifier in the spreadsheet header rows (e.g., a cell reading "LMU Toolbox Version: 41") and update the internal date labels whenever the file content is modified. For VBUS.xml, update the `"1 November, 2016"` date cell on row 2 to reflect the actual last content revision date. Consider adding the version string as part of a standard XML comment block (see A20-1).

---

**[A20-3]** — MEDIUM: Notes/Usage column sparsely populated; security-relevant parameters lack meaningful descriptions

**Description:** The `Notes/Usage` column (column 8) in ConfigParams.xml is the only documentation field for what each parameter does, what values are valid, and what security implications it has. For multiple security-relevant registers:

- ID 2306 `GPRS_CONTEXT_STRING` (hex 902): Notes/Usage is **empty**. This is the APN context string for cellular data connection. No description of valid content, length constraints, or security implications.
- ID 2311 `MAINT_REMOTE_PORT` (hex 907): Notes/Usage is **empty**. This is the maintenance server remote port number. No valid port range documented (the type says "16-bit unsigned" — range 0–65535 — but there is no note on recommended or restricted port numbers, or that this controls maintenance server access).

For the remaining security registers, the Notes/Usage content is a minimal placeholder string in angle brackets rather than a real description:
- ID 2308 `PAP_USER_STRING`: `"<PPP-PAP Auth Username string>"` — restates the parameter name; adds no information about length limits, character set restrictions, or usage context.
- ID 2309 `PAP_PWORD_STRING`: `"<PPP-PAP Auth Password string>"` — same issue.
- ID 2314 `PPP_USER_STRING`: `"<PPP-PAP/CHAP Auth Username string>"` — same issue.
- ID 2315 `PPP_PWORD_STRING`: `"<PPP-PAP/CHAP Auth Password string>"` — the type says "16-char null term" (max 16 chars) but the Notes/Usage does not warn that this is a tightly bounded field that could be silently truncated.
- ID 2319 `URL_INBOUND`: `"<Inbound Server URL string>"` — no guidance on acceptable URL format, expected protocol (UDP vs TCP), or security requirement to use TLS.
- ID 2320 `URL_MAINT`: `"<Maintenance Server URL string>"` — same issue.

Spot-checking additional rows confirms that many other parameters (e.g., COMM_INDEX ID 2317, NULLMSG_INTERVAL ID 2313, MAINT_REMOTE_ADDR ID 2310) also have empty Notes/Usage cells.

**Fix:** Populate the Notes/Usage column for all security-sensitive parameters (at minimum) with: (1) a one-sentence description of what the parameter controls, (2) valid value range or format constraints, (3) any security-relevant notes (e.g., "This field is transmitted in plaintext over cellular; avoid use of PAP in new deployments", "Port must be in range 1024–65535", "URL should use TLS endpoint"). For GPRS_CONTEXT_STRING and MAINT_REMOTE_PORT, this field should be considered required before further deployment script reviews.

---

**[A20-4]** — LOW: No valid-value ranges or units documented for numeric parameters

**Description:** The `Param Value Type` column in ConfigParams.xml records only the data type and size (e.g., `"16-bit unsigned"`, `"32-bit unsigned"`, `"8-bit unsigned"`). No column exists for minimum value, maximum value, units, or default value. For example:
- `MAINT_REMOTE_PORT` (ID 2311): typed as `"16-bit unsigned"` — valid range is 0–65535, but there is no documentation on what ports are expected or restricted.
- `NULLMSG_INTERVAL` (ID 2313): typed as `"16-bit unsigned"` — represents a time interval, but no unit (seconds? milliseconds?) is documented anywhere in the parameter entry.
- `GPRS_CONTEXT_INDEX` (ID 2307): `"8-bit unsigned"` — a context index, but valid range (0–N contexts) is undocumented.

The lack of units is particularly notable for time-interval and distance-related parameters: a developer writing a CSV script that sets a timer register could easily use the wrong scale if the unit is not documented.

**Fix:** Add a "Units" column and a "Valid Range" column to ConfigParams.xml. For existing parameters, populate these fields starting with the parameters most used in CSV scripts. At minimum, document units for all interval and threshold parameters referenced in the deployment CSV scripts.

---

**[A20-5]** — LOW: VBUS.xml worksheet name does not match file name; internal date label is stale

**Description:** The file `VBUS.xml` contains a single worksheet named `"ConfigParams"`. The worksheet name conflicts with the worksheet name in `ConfigParams.xml` (also `"ConfigParams"`). A developer or automated tool using the LMU Manager to load both files could encounter ambiguity if the tool references worksheets by name rather than by file. Additionally, the internal date label on row 2 of VBUS.xml reads `"1 November, 2016"`, but the `<DocumentProperties><LastSaved>` timestamp is `2020-10-31` — nearly four years later. This discrepancy means the displayed date is wrong and provides a false impression of when the J1939 SPN data was last updated.

**Fix:** Rename the VBUS.xml worksheet from `"ConfigParams"` to `"VBUSParams"` or `"J1939Params"` to avoid confusion with ConfigParams.xml. Update the internal date label on row 2 to reflect the actual last content revision date, and establish a practice of updating this cell whenever the file is edited.

---

**[A20-6]** — LOW: VBUS.xml column 10 is unlabeled ("?")

**Description:** The VBUS.xml column header row defines column 10 as `"? (10)"`. This is a placeholder label indicating the column's purpose was unknown or undocumented at the time the spreadsheet was created. The column is present across all ~9,854 data rows. Whatever data this column contains cannot be interpreted by any developer who did not author the file, and the `?` label provides no guidance for downstream use.

**Fix:** Identify the original intent of column 10 in VBUS.xml (likely from the CalAmp LMU Toolbox documentation or the original file author) and replace the `"?"` label with a descriptive column name. If the column is unused or the data is meaningless, the column should be formally documented as deprecated or removed.

---

**[A20-7]** — LOW: No schema (XSD) or structure documentation exists for any XML file

**Description:** None of the three XML files reference an XSD schema, nor does any XSD file exist anywhere in the repository. The XML structure used (Microsoft Office SpreadsheetML) is a proprietary format; the actual structure of interest — the columns, their ordering, their data types, and the row conventions in the parameter tables — is entirely undocumented outside of the file itself. Any automated tool (e.g., a script that parses ConfigParams.xml to extract parameter definitions for use in CSV generation or validation) must reverse-engineer the column layout from the data. There is no specification document explaining that column 2 is the decimal parameter ID, column 3 is the hex ID, column 7 is the type string, or column 8 is Notes/Usage.

**Fix:** Create a lightweight structure documentation document (or an XML comment block) that describes the column layout for each worksheet, the expected data types per column, and any special conventions (e.g., what the `LMDecoder` column format `"64A|ST"` means, how the `8-bit Max Index` / `32-bit Max Index` / `Linux Max Index` columns differ). This is especially important if any tooling is built to programmatically consume these files.

---

**[A20-8]** — LOW: Repository README does not explain the relationship between XML toolbox files and CSV deployment scripts

**Description:** The repository README.md (`C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/README.md`) describes the purpose of the CSV scripts and references the LMU Manager tool, but makes no mention of the three XML toolbox files in `CALAMP APPS/LMUToolbox_V41/`. A new developer reading the README would have no way to know:
- That ConfigParams.xml is a parameter registry whose IDs correspond to the register numbers in the CSV scripts.
- That PEG List.xml defines the trigger/condition/action codes used in PEG configuration rows of the CSV scripts.
- That VBUS.xml provides J1939 CAN bus SPN definitions relevant to vehicle data extraction.
- What the LMUToolbox_V41 version number signifies or whether it needs to be updated when upgrading firmware.
- How to update or extend these XML files when adding new parameters to a CSV script.

The README also references "it should be register in the 'registers'" for new scripts without clarifying what "registers" means or where that registry is.

**Fix:** Expand the README to include a section titled "LMU Toolbox Reference Files" that explains the purpose of each XML file, maps XML parameter IDs to CSV register columns, and clarifies the versioning scheme. Correct the grammatical issue in the existing README ("it should be register in the 'registers'" should read "it should be registered in the 'registers' list" — and define what that list is).
