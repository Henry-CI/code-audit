## Reading Evidence

### FILE 1: `62.134 Rayven CI PAPE Final Datamono.csv`

**Full path:** `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/US Script/PAPE/62.134 Rayven CI PAPE Final Datamono.csv`

**Row count:** 1230 data rows + 1 header row = 1231 total lines

**Header row (line 1):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`
- This is a structural CSV header only. It names the three columns. It contains no description of what the script does, what customer it is for, or what SIM carrier is targeted.

**Comment rows:** None. No lines beginning with `#` or any other comment character are present. The CSV format does not support a comment syntax natively, and no non-data rows exist beyond the column header.

**Unique parameter ID groups present (sampled):**
256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 283, 285, 286, 291, 512, 513, 515, 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 779, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 913, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1037, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1056, 1280, 1281, 1282, 1283, 1536, 1537, 1538, 1539, 1540, 2178, 2306, 2307, 2312, 2313, 2318, 2319, 2327, 3072, 3073, 3074, 3328, 3329, 3330, 3331, 3332, 3333

**Key decoded values relevant to documentation:**
- 2306[0] = `data.mono` (APN — Monogoto/Datamono SIM carrier)
- 2306[1] = `data.mono`
- 2319[0] = `52.164.241.179` (primary server IP)
- 2319[1] = `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (secondary server hostname)
- No 2308 (carrier name), no 2309 (carrier credential), no 2314/2315 (APN username/password)
- 3331[0] = `*****` (decoded from `2A2A2A2A2A00`)

**Filename analysis:**
- `62.134` — appears to be a version/script number; no convention is documented
- `Rayven` — platform/integration partner name
- `CI` — likely "CalAmp Integration" or "Continuous Integration"; not formally defined
- `PAPE` — customer name
- `Final` — disposition/state label, but no date, no author, no versioning scheme
- `Datamono` — SIM carrier variant (Monogoto Data.Mono APN)
- No country indicator (the PAPE folder is under `US Script/` which implies United States, but this is only inferrable from directory position, not the filename itself)

### FILE 2: `62.137 Rayven CI PAPE Final Pod.csv`

**Full path:** `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/US Script/PAPE/62.137 Rayven CI PAPE Final Pod.csv`

**Row count:** 1238 data rows + 1 header row = 1239 total lines

**Header row (line 1):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`
- Structural CSV header only. No script-level description.

**Comment rows:** None.

**Key decoded values relevant to documentation:**
- 2306[0] = `data641003` (APN — Kore Wireless)
- 2306[1] = `data641003`
- 2308[0] = `Kore` (carrier name)
- 2309[0] = `Kore123` (carrier credential — plaintext)
- 2314[0/1] = `dummy` (APN username placeholder)
- 2315[0/1] = `dummy` (APN password placeholder)
- 2316[0/1] = `*99***1#` (PPP dial string)
- 2319[0] = `52.164.241.179`
- 2319[1] = `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`
- 3331[0] = `*****`

**Filename analysis:**
- `62.137` — script number; 3 higher than 62.134, suggesting sequential versioning, but no scheme is documented
- `Rayven` — platform name
- `CI` — undefined abbreviation
- `PAPE` — customer
- `Final` — disposition label only; no timestamp or author
- `Pod` — SIM carrier variant (Kore "Pod" SIM type); the "Pod" label is informal and not defined in any documentation

---

### FILE 3: `62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv`

**Full path:** `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/US Script/PAPE/62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv`

**Row count:** 1237 data rows + 1 header row = 1238 total lines

**Header row (line 1):** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`
- Structural CSV header only. No script-level description.

**Comment rows:** None.

**Key decoded values relevant to documentation:**
- 2306[0] = `data641003` (APN — Kore, NOT Monogoto)
- 2306[1] = `data641003`
- 2308[0] = `Kore`
- 2309[0] = `Kore123`
- 2314[0/1] = `dummy`
- 2315[0/1] = `dummy`
- 2316[0/1] = `*99***1#`
- 2319[0] = `52.164.241.179` (single server only — no 2319[1])
- 3331[0] = `*****`
- 768[1] = `00000000` (differs from 62.134 and 62.137 which have `6704EB0F`)
- 769[1] = `5014` (differs from 62.134 and 62.137 which have `2AF8`)
- 1024[23] = `C8` (differs from 62.134 = `86`, 62.137 = `89`)

**Filename analysis:**
- `62.200` — jump from 62.137 to 62.200; the gap is unexplained and no versioning log exists
- `Rayven` — platform name
- Note: `CI` is absent here (present in 62.134 and 62.137 but dropped in 62.200); this omission is undocumented
- `PAPE` — customer
- `Final` — disposition label
- `Datamono Fixed` — implies a fix to the Datamono (Monogoto) variant, but actual content uses Kore APN, not Monogoto; this is a misleading label
- `Fixed` — no changelog, no description of what was fixed

---

### Repository-level documentation inventory

- `README.md` at repo root: present but minimal. States the repo contains "new scripts created for the Rayven CI transfer," directs scripts are divided by country and SIM type, and says new scripts need a "different version name" and should be "register[ed] in the 'registers'."
- **No "registers" file exists in the repository.** The README references a "registers" document that has not been committed. Only `URL & PORTS.xlsx` exists as a supplementary non-CSV file at the root.
- No customer requirements documentation exists anywhere in the repo (no per-customer README, no spec file, no change log).
- No parameter ID reference sheet exists in the repository. Parameter IDs such as 512, 768, 1024, 2306, 2309, 2319, 3331 are used without any in-repo definition.
- The PAPE subdirectory contains only CSV files; no README, no manifest, no SIM-type guide.

## Findings

**[A31-1]** — HIGH: No inline documentation in any file — parameter IDs are completely opaque without external reference material

**Description:** All three CSV files contain only a structural column header (`parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`) and no other descriptive content. There are no comment rows, no embedded script description, and no human-readable field names. The parameter ID numbers (e.g., 256, 512, 768, 1024, 2178, 2306, 2309, 2319, 3331) are CalAmp LMU device register addresses. Without the CalAmp LMU register reference manual, no reader can determine what any parameter configures, what values are valid, or what the script as a whole is intended to do. A technician working from the CSV file alone cannot safely modify or verify the script. For example, a reader who does not know that 2309 carries a carrier credential, or that 2319 is the server address, or that 2306 is the APN, cannot audit or modify the file without that external knowledge. The CSV format technically supports no native comment mechanism, but the `parameter_id` column could carry a human-readable label column if the toolchain allowed, or a companion documentation file could be maintained.
**Fix:** Create and commit a parameter ID reference file (e.g., `US Script/PAPE/REGISTERS.md` or a CSV companion) that maps at minimum the non-zero, non-default register IDs used across the PAPE scripts to their human-readable names and purposes. At a minimum, the most security-sensitive and operationally critical registers (2306 APN, 2308 carrier, 2309 carrier credential, 2314/2315 APN auth, 2319 server address, 3331 unknown field) should be named and described.

---

**[A31-2]** — HIGH: The "registers" documentation file referenced in README.md does not exist in the repository

**Description:** The repository `README.md` explicitly states: "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'." This implies a "registers" document is expected to exist as the authoritative record of all scripts and their purposes. No such file exists in the repository — no `registers` file of any type or format was found under any path. This means the versioning and tracking process described in the README is not being followed. Scripts 62.134, 62.137, and 62.200 are not documented in any registry. There is no way to determine from the repository when these scripts were created, by whom, or what they replaced.
**Fix:** Create the referenced "registers" file (the README implies it should exist). At minimum it should record: script filename, version number, customer, SIM carrier, creation date, author, and a brief description of what the script does or what changed from the prior version.

---

**[A31-3]** — HIGH: Filename "Datamono Fixed" in 62.200 is factually incorrect documentation — it describes the wrong SIM carrier

**Description:** The file `62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv` is labeled as a "fixed" version of the Datamono (Monogoto Data.Mono) script. However, its content configures the Kore carrier: APN `data641003`, carrier name `Kore` (register 2308), credential `Kore123` (register 2309), and APN placeholder credentials `dummy`. It does not use the `data.mono` APN from the true Datamono file (62.134). The word "Datamono" in the filename is therefore factually incorrect documentation — it will cause a technician expecting to deploy a Monogoto/Data.Mono SIM configuration to unknowingly apply a Kore configuration instead. Devices with Monogoto SIMs configured with this file will fail to connect to the cellular network. In addition, the word "Fixed" provides no information about what was fixed, from which previous version, or by whom.
**Fix:** Rename the file to accurately reflect its actual SIM carrier (Kore/Pod). If the file is intended to be a corrected Pod script, a name like `62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Pod Fixed.csv` would be accurate. If it was genuinely intended to fix the Datamono script, the carrier configuration must be corrected to use `data.mono`. In either case, a changelog entry or description of what "Fixed" means should be added to the registers document.

---

**[A31-4]** — MEDIUM: Filename convention omits country/region indicator in the filename itself

**Description:** The three filenames do not include a country or region code. The country context (United States) is only inferrable from the directory path (`US Script/PAPE/`). If a file is copied, attached to an email, or referenced outside the directory context, the country association is lost. The README notes that scripts "have been divided based on country with where the script sends data to mentioned on the name" — but in practice, none of these three filenames mention a country or region. Furthermore, 62.200 also drops the `CI` token that appears in 62.134 and 62.137 (both include `Rayven CI PAPE`; 62.200 reads `Rayven PAPE`). Whether `CI` is meaningful and why it was omitted is undocumented.
**Fix:** Adopt and document a filename convention that includes at minimum: customer code, country/region code, SIM carrier name, script purpose, and version number. Example: `PAPE-US-Kore-Pod-v62.137.csv`. Apply this convention to all new scripts and consider renaming existing files with a migration note.

---

**[A31-5]** — MEDIUM: No version lineage or changelog documentation — the relationship between script versions is entirely undocumented

**Description:** The three files represent at least two distinct version lineages for the PAPE customer: a Datamono line (62.134) and a Pod/Kore line (62.137, and ambiguously 62.200). The numeric prefix (`62.134`, `62.137`, `62.200`) implies sequential versioning, but:
- The gap between 62.137 and 62.200 (a jump of 63 version numbers) is unexplained.
- There is no changelog file explaining what changed between versions.
- There is no git commit message history that describes the changes (the PAPE files were added in a single commit without per-file change descriptions).
- The `Final` label appears in all three files, making it impossible to determine which is the currently deployed version.
- The `Fixed` label in 62.200 references an unspecified prior defect with no description.

Without a version changelog, a technician cannot determine which script is current, what was wrong with previous versions, or whether deploying 62.200 is safe.
**Fix:** Maintain a per-customer CHANGELOG file (e.g., `US Script/PAPE/CHANGELOG.md`) documenting each script version: what changed from the previous version, the date, the author, and the reason for the change. Tag git commits with meaningful messages when scripts are modified.

---

**[A31-6]** — MEDIUM: No customer requirements documentation — the specific PAPE customer configuration rationale is entirely absent

**Description:** There is no document in the repository explaining why PAPE requires these specific parameter values, what hardware the scripts target, what the "Rayven CI" integration is, or what the difference is between a customer needing a Datamono vs. a Pod SIM configuration. The scripts contain hundreds of parameter settings (register 512 alone has 250 indexed entries, register 779 has 250 indexed entries) with no explanation of why any particular value was chosen for this customer versus a default or another customer. For example:
- Why does PAPE require two SIM carrier variants (Datamono and Pod)?
- What devices does PAPE use (LMU model number)?
- What does the `Rayven CI` in the filename mean operationally?
- What triggered the creation of the "Fixed" variant?

Without customer requirements documentation, scripts cannot be independently validated for correctness, and future engineers cannot safely modify them.
**Fix:** Create a customer specification document for PAPE (e.g., `US Script/PAPE/PAPE-customer-spec.md`) that records: device model(s), SIM types in use, server endpoint(s), rationale for non-default parameter choices, and the meaning of each script variant. This does not need to cover every register, but should cover the operationally and security-relevant ones.

---

**[A31-7]** — LOW: The `CI` token in filenames 62.134 and 62.137 is undefined and is inconsistently applied

**Description:** Files `62.134 Rayven CI PAPE Final Datamono.csv` and `62.137 Rayven CI PAPE Final Pod.csv` include the token `CI` between `Rayven` and `PAPE`. File `62.200 Rayven PAPE Final Datamono Fixed.csv` omits `CI`. The README mentions "Rayven CI transfer" in passing, which suggests `CI` may stand for "CalAmp Integration" or refer to a specific project or deployment phase. However:
- The term is not defined anywhere in the repository.
- It appears in the README description of the repository's purpose but not as a defined term.
- Its omission from 62.200 is unexplained and may indicate it was dropped intentionally (e.g., if it referred to a specific migration phase that completed) or accidentally.
**Fix:** Define the `CI` token in the README or a naming convention document. If it represents a migration phase or integration type, document whether it remains applicable to new scripts. If it was intentionally dropped in 62.200, document why.

---

**[A31-8]** — LOW: The `Final` label is used on all scripts but has no operational meaning given that multiple "Final" versions coexist

**Description:** All three files use the word `Final` in their filename. In a repository with a single `Final` script per carrier type, this label could convey that the script is production-ready and no longer in draft. However, with three coexisting `Final` files (62.134 Final Datamono, 62.137 Final Pod, 62.200 Final Datamono Fixed), the label provides no useful signal about which file is currently deployed or which supersedes the others. The label cannot be used to distinguish between a draft and a production script, and it provides no timestamp or authorship context.
**Fix:** Replace the `Final` label in filenames with a versioned scheme that includes a date or build number (e.g., `v1`, `v2`, `2025-10-01`). Reserve `Final` only if it has a defined meaning in the project workflow, and document that meaning.

---

**[A31-9]** — INFO: No device model or firmware version is documented in filenames or file content

**Description:** None of the three files indicate which CalAmp LMU hardware model or firmware version they target. CalAmp LMU devices span several models (LMU-1100, LMU-2000, LMU-3000 series, etc.) with different register sets and capabilities. The register 1024 sub-indices and some of the 3000-series registers (3072-3333) may be model-specific. Without knowing the target hardware, it is impossible to verify that all parameter IDs are valid for the device in use or to safely adapt the script to a different model.
**Fix:** Document the target device model and firmware version in the filename or in a companion specification document for the PAPE customer scripts.

---

**[A31-10]** — INFO: The `URL & PORTS.xlsx` file at the repository root is not linked or referenced from PAPE scripts or documentation

**Description:** A file named `URL & PORTS.xlsx` exists at the repository root. This may contain the server endpoint documentation for the addresses embedded in register 2319 (e.g., `52.164.241.179`, `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`). However, there is no reference to this file from any script, README section, or per-customer directory. A technician working in `US Script/PAPE/` would not necessarily know this file exists or that it documents the server endpoints used in the scripts.
**Fix:** Add a reference to `URL & PORTS.xlsx` in the main README and in any per-customer documentation that is created. If the file documents which server endpoints map to which environments or customers, that information is directly relevant to validating the 2319 register values in these scripts.
