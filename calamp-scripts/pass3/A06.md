## Reading Evidence

### FILE 1: `Aus Script/DPWorld/61.36 CI DPWORLD Telstra Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1252 (including header row 1)
**Column structure:** `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value` — standard 3-column format
**Header/comment rows:** Row 1 is the standard CSV column header only; no free-text comment rows.

**Filename analysis:**
- `61.36` — script version number prefix (series 61, build 36)
- `CI DPWORLD` — customer identifier: DP World (a port/logistics operator), "CI" likely denotes the CalAmp/CI platform variant
- `Telstra` — SIM carrier: Telstra (Australian carrier)
- `Final` — indicates a production-ready script

**Unique parameter ID groups used:** 256–291, 512–515, 768–779, 902–909, 913, 1024–1056, 1280–1283, 1536–1540, 2176, 2178, 2306–2316, 2318–2320, 2322, 2327, 3072–3074, 3328–3333

**Key decoded values:**
- Reg 2306,0/1 = `74656C737472612E696E7465726E657400` → `telstra.internet` (APN)
- Reg 2308,0 = `4B6F726500` → `Kore` (carrier/operator name)
- Reg 2309,0 = `4B6F726531323300` → `Kore123` (credential-like value)
- Reg 2311,0 = `5014` → hex = decimal 20500 (server port)
- Reg 2314,0/1 = `64756D6D7900` → `dummy` (APN username placeholder)
- Reg 2315,0/1 = `64756D6D7900` → `dummy` (APN password placeholder)
- Reg 2316,0/1 = `2A39392A2A2A312300` → `*99***1#` (dial string)
- Reg 2318,0 = `2A323238393900` → `*22899`
- Reg 2319,0 = `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (primary server)
- Reg 2320,0 = `6D61696E742E76656869636C652D6C6F636174696F6E2E636F6D00` → `maint.vehicle-location.com` (secondary/maintenance server)
- Reg 2322,0 = `00015180` → decimal 86400 (likely heartbeat interval, 24 hours in seconds)
- Reg 3331,0 = `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****` (masked value)

---

### FILE 2: `Aus Script/DPWorld/61.37 CI DPWORLD Data.mono Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1252 (including header)
**Column structure:** standard 3-column format, no comment rows

**Filename analysis:**
- `61.37` — script version (series 61, build 37; one increment from 61.36)
- `CI DPWORLD` — same customer as above
- `Data.mono` — SIM carrier: Monogoto (written `Data.mono`; `data.mono` is the Monogoto APN name)
- `Final` — production-ready

**Key decoded values:**
- Reg 2306,0/1 = `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → `data.mono` (Monogoto APN — differs from 61.36)
- Reg 2308,0 → `Kore`; Reg 2309,0 → `Kore123` (same as 61.36)
- Reg 2311,0 = `5014` → port 20500
- Reg 2314,0/1 → `dummy`; Reg 2315,0/1 → `dummy`
- Reg 2316,0/1 → `*99***1#`
- Reg 2318,0 → `*22899`
- Reg 2319,0 → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (same primary server as 61.36)
- Reg 2320 — absent (differs from 61.36)
- Reg 3331,0 → `*****`
- Reg 2322 — absent (differs from 61.36)

**Difference from 61.36:** APN switched to `data.mono` (Monogoto); secondary server (2320) and heartbeat (2322) registers removed; otherwise content is near-identical.

---

### FILE 3: `Aus Script/Keller/61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`

**Row count:** 1230 (including header)
**Column structure:** standard 3-column format, no comment rows

**Filename analysis:**
- `61.101` — version (series 61, build 101)
- `Rayven Keller` — customer: Keller (industrial products); "Rayven" denotes the Rayven IoT platform integration
- `Demo` — explicitly marked as a demo/test script
- `Blank APN` — APN fields are intentionally blank/not configured

**Key decoded values:**
- Reg 2306 — absent (APN blank, consistent with "Blank APN" in filename)
- Reg 2308,0 → `Kore`; Reg 2309,0 → `Kore123`
- Reg 2311 — absent; Reg 2313,0 = `0000` (port/timeout cleared)
- Reg 2314/2315 — absent
- Reg 2318,0 → `*22899`
- Reg 2319,0 = `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → `52.164.241.179` (raw IP, no hostname)
- Reg 3331,0 → `*****`

**Structural difference from DPWorld files:** Smaller (1230 vs 1252 rows); absent connectivity registers (2306, 2311, 2314, 2315, 2320, 2322) reflect the "Demo Blank APN" purpose.

---

### FILE 4: `Aus Script/Keller/61.111 Optimal Script for Keller.csv`

**Row count:** 1230 (including header)
**Column structure:** standard 3-column format, no comment rows

**Filename analysis:**
- `61.111` — version (series 61, build 111; 10 increments past 61.101)
- `Optimal Script for Keller` — customer: Keller; "Optimal" indicates this is the recommended production script
- No carrier name in filename

**Key decoded values:**
- Reg 2306 — absent (no APN configured)
- Reg 2308,0 → `Kore`; Reg 2309,0 → `Kore123`
- Reg 2311 — absent
- Reg 2318,0 → `*22899`
- Reg 2319,0 → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (hostname, unlike 61.101 which used raw IP)
- Reg 3331,0 → `*****`

**Notable difference from 61.101:** Server endpoint changed from raw IP `52.164.241.179` to hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`, suggesting 61.111 is a later, corrected version. Carrier still not specified in filename.

### FILE 5: `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/61.133 Rayven and CI clone Komatsu Telstra Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1231 (including header)
**Column structure:** standard 3-column format, no comment rows

**Filename analysis:**
- `61.133` — version (series 61, build 133)
- `Rayven and CI clone` — indicates this script covers both Rayven and CI (CargoIntel/CalAmp Intelligence) device configurations
- `Komatsu` — customer: Komatsu Australia (mining equipment)
- `Telstra` — SIM carrier
- `Final` — production-ready

**Key decoded values:**
- Reg 2306 — absent (no APN)
- Reg 2308,0 → `Kore`; Reg 2309,0 → `Kore123`
- Reg 2318,0 → `*22899`
- Reg 2319,0 → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`; Reg 2319,1 = `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → `52.164.241.179` (fallback IP)
- Reg 3331,0 → `*****`

---

### FILE 6: `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/61.135 Rayven and CI clone Komatsu Data.mono Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1233 (including header)
**Column structure:** standard 3-column format, no comment rows

**Filename analysis:**
- `61.135` — version (series 61, build 135; two increments past 61.133)
- `Rayven and CI clone Komatsu` — same customer/platform pair as 61.133
- `Data.mono` — SIM carrier: Monogoto
- `Final` — production-ready

**Key decoded values:**
- Reg 2306,0/1 → `data.mono` (Monogoto APN)
- Reg 2308,0 → `Kore`; Reg 2309,0 → `Kore123`
- Reg 2318,0 → `*22899`
- Reg 2319,0 → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`; Reg 2319,1 → `52.164.241.179`
- Reg 3331,0 → `*****`

**Difference from 61.133:** APN set to `data.mono`; otherwise near-identical.

---

### FILE 7: `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/69.001 RD Komatsu Telstra Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1230 (including header)
**Column structure:** standard 3-column format, no comment rows

**Filename analysis:**
- `69.001` — version (series 69, build 001; different series from 61.x files — likely a different device type or script generation)
- `RD` — meaning is not documented anywhere in the file or repository; presumed to indicate a device model, script revision series, or configuration profile (e.g., "Remote Device" or "Relay Device")
- `Komatsu` — customer: Komatsu
- `Telstra` — SIM carrier
- `Final` — production-ready

**Key decoded values:**
- Reg 2306 — absent
- Reg 2308,0 → `Kore`; Reg 2309,0 → `Kore123`
- Reg 2318,0 → `*22899`
- Reg 2319,0 → `52.164.241.179` (raw IP only, no hostname; differs from 61.133)
- Reg 3331,0 → `*****`
- Reg 2311 — absent; Reg 2313,0 = `0000`

---

### FILE 8: `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/69.002 RD Komatsu Monogoto Final.csv`

**Row count:** 1232 (including header)
**Column structure:** standard 3-column format, no comment rows

**Filename analysis:**
- `69.002` — version (series 69, build 002)
- `RD Komatsu` — same series/customer as 69.001
- `Monogoto` — SIM carrier (spelled out in full here rather than `Data.mono`)
- `Final` — production-ready

**Key decoded values:**
- Reg 2306,0/1 → `data.mono` (Monogoto APN)
- Reg 2308,0 → `Kore`; Reg 2309,0 → `Kore123`
- Reg 2318,0 → `*22899`
- Reg 2319,0 → `52.164.241.179` (raw IP only)
- Reg 3331,0 → `*****`

**Difference from 69.001:** APN set to `data.mono`; otherwise near-identical.

### Repository-Level Documentation

A `README.md` exists at the repository root. Its relevant content:

> "This Repo contains all the new scripts created for the Rayven CI transfer. Currently these have been divided based on country with where the script sends data to mentioned on the name along with the type of SIM the script is for."
> "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'"

No manifest, register map, change log, or customer-specific documentation exists alongside any of the CSV files. The README references a "registers" document but no such document is present in the repository.

## Findings

**[A06-1]** — HIGH: Undocumented script series prefix "RD" — meaning is unknown and not defined anywhere

**Description:** Files `69.001 RD Komatsu Telstra Final.csv` and `69.002 RD Komatsu Monogoto Final.csv` carry the prefix `RD` whose meaning is not explained in any filename, comment, README, or accompanying document. The series number also changes from 61.x to 69.x with no explanation of what the series boundary signifies. Without knowing what `RD` means (Remote Device? Relay Device? a specific LMU model number? a revision designation?), operators cannot determine which physical devices these scripts target, whether the scripts are appropriate for a given device batch, or how the 69.x series relates to 61.x scripts for the same customer. Deploying the wrong script to the wrong device type can cause silent misconfiguration.
**Fix:** Define all filename prefix conventions — including what `RD` and the series numbers (61, 69) mean — in a naming-convention document or in the README. Add an inline comment row or a sidecar `.txt` file to each `RD` script clarifying the target device model and how this script differs from the corresponding 61.x script.

---

**[A06-2]** — HIGH: "Optimal Script" filename contains no carrier information, making deployment target ambiguous

**Description:** `61.111 Optimal Script for Keller.csv` does not include a SIM carrier name in its filename, whereas every other "Final" script in the repository includes `Telstra`, `Data.mono`, or `Monogoto` in the filename to indicate the intended carrier. This file also has no APN configured (register 2306 is absent), meaning the carrier cannot be inferred from the content either. The "Optimal" label implies this should be the preferred or default script for Keller, but without a carrier designation an operator cannot determine which SIM card population it is intended for. The companion demo file (`61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv`) also lacks a carrier name but that file is explicitly labelled as a demo with a blank APN; `61.111` carries no such label, and the word "Optimal" suggests production use.
**Fix:** Add the intended carrier name to the filename (e.g., `61.111 Rayven Keller Optimal Telstra Final.csv`) or add a sidecar document confirming the intended carrier. If the script is truly carrier-agnostic, document that explicitly in the filename or a README note.

---

**[A06-3]** — MEDIUM: No inline documentation in any file — no device model, customer context, or purpose is encoded within the CSV content itself

**Description:** All eight files share the same structural gap: the only human-readable information about a script is in its filename. None of the files contain a comment row (e.g., a line beginning with `#` or a descriptive header value) that identifies the target device model (LMU1220? LMU4200?), the customer, the intended carrier, the configuration purpose, or the script version history. The CSV format used by CalAmp LMU Manager does not natively support comment rows, but the `parameter_id` field is free-text from the repository's perspective — a leading metadata row with a non-numeric ID would be silently ignored by a non-conforming tool, or a sidecar `.txt`/`.json` file could carry this information. As a result, a script loaded directly into a provisioning tool carries no self-describing metadata; if the file is renamed or moved the context is permanently lost.
**Fix:** For each script, create a sidecar metadata file (e.g., `61.36 CI DPWORLD Telstra Final.notes.txt`) recording: target device model, customer name, SIM carrier, intended server endpoint, script author, creation date, and a brief description of what distinguishes this variant from others. Alternatively, adopt a structured JSON manifest for each subdirectory. The README already instructs that scripts "should be register in the 'registers'" but no register document exists; that document should be created and maintained.

---

**[A06-4]** — MEDIUM: Register parameter IDs are not documented within the scripts or in any accompanying reference

**Description:** All eight files use parameter IDs (register numbers) whose meaning is entirely opaque to anyone without access to the CalAmp LMU device manual. For example: register 2309 encodes a credential-like value (`Kore123`), register 3331 encodes a masked value (`*****`), register 2178 encodes a structured AT-command tag string, and registers 512–515 encode complex packed event configuration words. None of these are annotated. The README references "registers" as a concept but no register dictionary, lookup table, or even partial mapping is present in the repository. This means: (a) any team member without device documentation cannot interpret or safely modify a script; (b) security reviews require out-of-band knowledge to identify sensitive registers; (c) scripts cannot be audited for correctness without external documentation.
**Fix:** Create a `registers.md` or `registers.csv` document at the repository root (or in a `docs/` folder) that maps at minimum the security-sensitive and commonly-used parameter IDs to their human-readable names, data types, and expected value ranges. Priority registers to document include: 2306 (APN), 2308 (carrier name), 2309 (carrier credential), 2311 (port), 2314 (APN username), 2315 (APN password), 2316 (dial string), 2318 (network identifier), 2319 (primary server), 2320 (secondary server), 3331 (masked field), and 2178 (AT command string).

---

**[A06-5]** — MEDIUM: Carrier name inconsistency — Monogoto APN carrier is labelled `Data.mono` in some filenames and `Monogoto` in others

**Description:** The Monogoto carrier is referred to as `Data.mono` in `61.37`, `61.135`, and `69.002` filenames, but as `Monogoto` in `69.002`. (Comparing: `61.37 CI DPWORLD Data.mono Final.csv`, `61.135 Rayven and CI clone Komatsu Data.mono Final.csv`, and `69.002 RD Komatsu Monogoto Final.csv`.) The APN value in all three is identical (`data.mono`), confirming they all target the same carrier. The inconsistent labelling means a search or filter for "Monogoto" files would miss the `Data.mono`-labelled files and vice versa. This creates a documentation and operational risk where scripts for the same carrier cannot be reliably enumerated.
**Fix:** Standardise the carrier label across all filenames to either `Data.mono` or `Monogoto` (whichever the organisation prefers) and apply the correction retroactively to existing filenames. Document the chosen convention in the README or a naming-convention document.

---

**[A06-6]** — MEDIUM: No version history or change log — the difference between consecutive script versions is undocumented

**Description:** The repository contains multiple version pairs for the same customer and carrier (e.g., 61.133 and 61.135 for Komatsu Telstra and Data.mono; 61.36 and 61.37 for DPWorld; 61.101 and 61.111 for Keller). In each case the only visible difference is a version number increment in the filename. There is no changelog, commit message, or sidecar document explaining what changed between versions. For example: 61.111 uses `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` as the server while 61.101 uses `52.164.241.179` — a significant operational difference — but this change is not documented anywhere. A technician applying scripts must compare files manually to understand what changed and why.
**Fix:** For each script variant, include a brief change note either in the filename suffix (e.g., `...v111-changed-server-to-hostname.csv`) or in a sidecar `.notes.txt` file. Maintain a top-level `CHANGELOG.md` or per-customer log that records what changed between version numbers and why. Git commit messages should also be used to document the purpose of each script addition or modification.

---

**[A06-7]** — MEDIUM: README references a "registers" document that does not exist in the repository

**Description:** The repository README states "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'". This instruction implies a document or system called "registers" where scripts are catalogued. No such document exists in the repository. This creates two documentation gaps: (1) the mapping of script versions to their purpose/target is missing; (2) new contributors following the README instructions will look for a register document, fail to find it, and either skip the registration step or not know where to add the information.
**Fix:** Create the "registers" document referenced in the README. At minimum it should be a table with columns: Script filename, Customer, Country, Target device model, SIM carrier, Server endpoint, Script author, Date created, Brief description. Place it in the repository root or in a `docs/` folder. Update the README to link to it directly.

---

**[A06-8]** — LOW: APN usernames and passwords set to the placeholder `dummy` and committed to the repository

**Description:** In `61.36 CI DPWORLD Telstra Final.csv`, registers 2314 (APN username, both indices) and 2315 (APN password, both indices) decode to the string `dummy`. This is a well-known placeholder string that may indicate the values have been intentionally left as non-functional placeholders or that the real credentials were replaced before commit. The word `dummy` is committed in plaintext in a production-labelled (`Final`) script. While `dummy` is unlikely to be a real credential, its presence is undocumented: there is no comment or README note explaining that these fields are intentionally set to a non-functional placeholder, or whether the device itself ignores these fields when using Telstra. A reader cannot determine whether `dummy` is correct for this carrier configuration or is an oversight.
**Fix:** Add a note (sidecar document or README section) clarifying that registers 2314 and 2315 are set to `dummy` intentionally for Telstra configurations because Telstra's APN does not require authentication credentials, and that `dummy` is an accepted placeholder for that network. If `dummy` is not intentional, replace it with appropriate values through a secrets-management process.

---

**[A06-9]** — LOW: The "Demo" and "Blank APN" script for Keller (`61.101`) is stored in the same directory as production scripts with no differentiation mechanism

**Description:** `61.101 Rayven Keller Demo Blank APN.csv` is stored in `Aus Script/Keller/` alongside `61.111 Optimal Script for Keller.csv`. The word `Demo` and `Blank APN` in the filename provide some disambiguation, but there is no directory separation, no manifest, and no README in the `Keller/` subdirectory to alert a technician that one file is a demo/test script and the other is the production script. A provisioning workflow that selects scripts from this directory could accidentally apply the demo (blank APN) script to production devices.
**Fix:** Move demo and test scripts to a separate subdirectory (e.g., `Aus Script/Keller/test/` or `Aus Script/Keller/archive/`) to physically separate them from production scripts. Add a `README.txt` in the `Keller/` directory listing active production scripts and their intended use.

---

**[A06-10]** — INFO: The repository README does not name the target device model, firmware version, or supported device families

**Description:** The README states the repository contains "scripts created for the Rayven CI transfer" and instructs users to use "LMU Manager" to edit them, but does not specify which CalAmp LMU device family the scripts are for (LMU1220, LMU2630, LMU4200, etc.), what firmware version is required for the parameter IDs used, or whether the scripts are compatible across multiple device models. This information is important for: (a) determining whether a script is valid for a particular device before deploying it; (b) understanding version compatibility; (c) onboarding new team members.
**Fix:** Add a section to the README specifying the target device model(s), supported firmware versions, and any known compatibility constraints between script series (61.x vs 69.x) and device models.
