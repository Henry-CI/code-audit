Both commits were made on the same date (2024-02-02), three minutes apart. Neither commit message describes what these files are, where they came from, or under what terms they are stored.

### Repository-wide documentation check

**README.md (repo root):** Exists. Relevant content:

> "Get the folder 'CALAMP APPS' to your local and extract the LMU Manager. You can also get the latest version from CALAMP developer portal."

The README mentions the LMU Manager once, in a setup step. It does not:
- Name the specific version committed (`8.9.10.7`)
- Provide a download URL or hash for verification
- State under what license the committed EXE may be stored or distributed
- Mention `AppendCRC16ToBin` or `x.bin` at all
- Explain what `AppendCRC16` means or does

**Other documentation files found:** None in `CALAMP APPS/`. No `README`, `README.md`, `README.txt`, `NOTICE`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG`, or manifest file exists in `CALAMP APPS/`, `CALAMP APPS/AppendCRC16ToBin/`, or anywhere in the repository other than the root `README.md`.

**Repository-wide search for "AppendCRC16":** Only references are within this audit's own output files and in `audit/2026-02-27-01/pass0/process.md`. No production documentation exists.

**Repository-wide search for "CRC":** Only references are in this audit's output files and one unrelated mention in `LMUToolbox_V41/VBUS.xml` (a description of a vehicle bus parameter, not related to the AppendCRC16 tool).

**Repository-wide search for "license" or "copyright":** No license or copyright text exists anywhere in production repository files. The only reference is in prior audit outputs.

## Findings

**[A02-1]** — HIGH: No documentation whatsoever for `AppendCRC16ToBin/x.bin`

**Description:** A zero-byte file named `x.bin` is committed inside a directory named `AppendCRC16ToBin`. There is no README, comment file, commit message detail, or any other document anywhere in the repository that explains: (1) what `AppendCRC16ToBin` is or does, (2) what `x.bin` is or is supposed to contain, (3) whether the zero-byte state is intentional (placeholder directory, failed export, erased binary, or empty template), or (4) how this directory or its contents relate to the rest of the repository. A CRC16 append operation is a firmware/binary patching step commonly used to append a cyclic redundancy check value to a binary firmware file before flashing to a device. If this directory is meant to hold a utility for preparing firmware files for CalAmp devices, its absence of content and documentation is a significant operational gap. If the file is a placeholder or artefact of a partially completed operation, its presence in version control is misleading and confusing.

**Fix:** Determine the intended purpose of `AppendCRC16ToBin/x.bin` from the original committer (Rhythm Duwadi per git history). Then either: (a) replace `x.bin` with the actual tool or firmware binary and add a `README.md` explaining the tool's purpose, source, version, input/output, and how it is invoked; or (b) if the directory is a placeholder or artefact with no current use, remove it from the repository entirely. In either case, document the outcome in the repository README.

**[A02-2]** — HIGH: `LMUMgr_8.9.10.7.zip` committed with no license, provenance, or distribution rights documentation

**Description:** A ~2.4 MB ZIP file containing the CalAmp LMU Manager Windows application (`LMUMgr 8.9.10.7.exe`, 6.9 MB uncompressed) is committed directly into the repository. The EXE self-identifies as "CalAmp LMU Manager (TM)" — a proprietary commercial product by CalAmp Corp. There is no license file, NOTICE file, or any statement anywhere in the repository indicating: (a) whether CalAmp permits redistribution of this software via a version control system, (b) under what terms the software was originally obtained, (c) whether a developer agreement with CalAmp permits storage in this repository, or (d) who is authorised to access and use this software.

The README states "You can also get the latest version from CALAMP developer portal," implying this is controlled-access vendor software obtained through a developer programme. Storing a vendor executable in a Bitbucket repository (even a private one) and distributing it to all repository cloners is likely a violation of the CalAmp developer agreement unless CalAmp explicitly permits redistribution. This creates legal and compliance exposure.

Additionally, the committed version (8.9.10.7, dated 2023-04-05) may be outdated relative to the CalAmp developer portal, meaning repository users may be working with a stale tool version without being aware of it.

**Fix:** (1) Review the CalAmp developer agreement to confirm whether redistribution via source control is permitted. (2) If redistribution is not permitted, remove the ZIP from the repository using `git rm --cached` and add `*.zip` to `.gitignore`, then update the README to provide a direct link to the official CalAmp developer portal download page and a SHA-256 hash of the known-good version for verification. (3) If redistribution is permitted, add a `CALAMP APPS/LICENSE.txt` document quoting the relevant terms, the software version, and the date it was obtained. (4) Add the specific version number and a link to release notes in the README setup section.

**[A02-3]** — MEDIUM: No README or explanatory document in the `CALAMP APPS/` directory or any sub-directory

**Description:** The `CALAMP APPS/` directory contains a ZIP archive (proprietary vendor software), an empty binary file in a cryptically named sub-directory, and a set of XML toolbox definition files — none of which have any accompanying documentation at the directory level. A developer encountering this repository for the first time has no way to know: (a) what each item in `CALAMP APPS/` is for, (b) how they relate to each other, (c) which items are inputs to a workflow vs. reference material vs. tools, or (d) what the correct procedure is for using them together. The root README mentions "CALAMP APPS" only in a single setup sentence and does not describe the directory structure.

**Fix:** Create a `CALAMP APPS/README.md` (or add a dedicated section to the root README) that lists each item in the directory, its purpose, and how it is used in the workflow. At minimum: explain that `LMUMgr_8.9.10.7.zip` is the CalAmp LMU Manager application used to edit CSV script files; explain what `AppendCRC16ToBin/` is intended to contain and when it is used in the firmware workflow; and explain the role of the `LMUToolbox_V41/` XML files.

**[A02-4]** — MEDIUM: Version provenance of `LMUMgr_8.9.10.7.zip` is unverifiable

**Description:** There is no hash, digital signature, or authoritative reference to confirm that the committed `LMUMgr_8.9.10.7.zip` (SHA-256: `f6f2be4518f7a5981986570a7c7d0dc759fe57e90b5594a752d1793264d1487d`) is the genuine, unmodified CalAmp release. The file was added in commit `f14c76c` with only the message "Added the LMU Manager" and no reference to where it was obtained. A substituted or tampered version of a device configuration tool could be used to introduce malicious configurations across all CalAmp devices managed through this repository. Without a verifiable hash from an authoritative CalAmp source, there is no way to distinguish a legitimate copy from a tampered one.

**Fix:** Publish the SHA-256 hash of the committed ZIP alongside a reference to the official CalAmp developer portal download page in the repository documentation. Ideally, verify the hash against the portal's published checksum (if available) and document the verification date. If the file is removed from the repository per the recommendation in A02-2, this finding is resolved as part of that remediation.

**[A02-5]** — LOW: No version history or changelog for the committed vendor tool

**Description:** The README instructs users to use `LMUMgr_8.9.10.7.zip` and notes that the "latest version" can also be obtained from the CalAmp developer portal. However, the repository records no information about why version 8.9.10.7 was chosen, whether newer versions exist, what changed between versions, or when an upgrade was last evaluated. With the EXE timestamp of 2023-04-05 and this audit date of 2026-02-28, the committed tool is approximately three years old. No record exists of whether anyone has checked for updates since it was first committed.

**Fix:** Document the rationale for the committed version (e.g., "last tested and validated against LMUToolbox_V41"), the date last reviewed, and the process for upgrading the committed tool when a new version is obtained from the CalAmp developer portal. A one-line comment in the setup README section or a `CALAMP APPS/VERSION.txt` file is sufficient.
