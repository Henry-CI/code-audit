# Pass 3 Documentation — Agent A19
**Files:** UK Script/ (second batch)
**Branch:** main
**Date:** 2026-02-28

## Scope

The `UK Script/` directory contains exactly two CSV files (alphabetically):

1. `161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv`
2. `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`

With two files total, the "second batch" (second third) is `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`. Because the two files are closely related and share all the same documentation deficiencies, findings are reported to cover both files where they share the gap, and individually where they differ.

## Reading Evidence

### FILE 1: `161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv`

**Full path:** `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/UK Script/161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv`

**Line count:** 1235 lines total — 1 header row (`parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`) + 1234 data rows + 1 blank trailing line.

**Header/comment rows:** One structural CSV header on line 1. No comment rows, no human-readable description rows.

**Unique parameter IDs (top-level):** 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 283, 285, 286, 291, 512, 513, 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 779, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 913, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1037, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1056, 1280, 1281, 1282, 1283, 1536, 1537, 1539, 1540, 2176, 2178, 2306, 2307, 2311, 2312, 2313, 2319, 2320, 2322, 2327, 3072, 3073, 3074, 3328, 3329, 3330, 3331, 3332, 3333

**Key decoded values:**
- Register 2306,0 and 2306,1: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → `data.mono` (APN — Monogoto carrier)
- Register 2307,0: `00` (APN index/type)
- Register 2311,0: `5014` = 0x5014 = 20500 decimal (server port)
- Register 2312,0: `0011` = 17 decimal
- Register 2313,0: `0000`
- Register 2319,0: `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (primary server hostname)
- Register 2320,0: `646D2E63616C616D702E636F2E756B00` → `dm.calamp.co.uk` (secondary server — CalAmp UK device management)
- Register 2322,0: `00015180` = 86400 seconds (24 hours — heartbeat interval)
- Register 2178,0: `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` → `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` (modem AT command string)
- Register 3331,0: `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****` (five asterisks — purpose unknown/undocumented)
- Register 768,0: `6704EB0F` (device unit serial number or ID — 32-bit value)
- Register 769,0: `2AF8` = 11000 decimal (timing register — report interval in some unit)
- Registers 2308, 2309 (carrier name, carrier credential): ABSENT
- Registers 2314, 2315 (APN username, APN password): ABSENT

**Filename analysis:**
- `161` — appears to be a script series/family number used across CalAmp scripts
- `.31` — version or variant suffix within the 161 series
- `CI` — likely a customer abbreviation; not spelled out; could be "CI" (a UK company name), but is undocumented
- `only` — qualifier word suggesting a restricted or stripped-down variant (vs. full configuration), but purpose is not documented
- `Data.Mono` — references the Monogoto Data SIM carrier and APN `data.mono`
- `Final` — denotes a finalised (production-ready) version, not a draft
- `.csv` — file format

**Country indicator:** None. There is no "UK" or country code in the filename despite being stored in `UK Script/`. The directory provides the only country context.

### FILE 2: `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`

**Full path:** `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/UK Script/161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`

**Line count:** 1235 lines total — 1 header row + 1234 data rows + 1 blank trailing line.

**Header/comment rows:** One structural CSV header on line 1. No comment rows, no human-readable description rows.

**Unique parameter IDs:** Identical set to File 1.

**Key decoded values:**
- Register 2306,0 and 2306,1: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` → `data.mono` (same APN as File 1)
- Register 2307,0: `00`
- Register 2311,0: `5014` = 20500 decimal (same port as File 1)
- Register 2312,0: `0011` = 17 decimal (same as File 1)
- Register 2313,0: `0000`
- Register 2319,0: `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` → `52.164.241.179` (primary server — bare Azure IP, NOT a hostname)
- Register 2320,0: `646D2E63616C616D702E636F2E756B00` → `dm.calamp.co.uk` (same secondary server as File 1)
- Register 2322,0: `00015180` = 86400 seconds (same heartbeat as File 1)
- Register 2178,0: `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` → `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` (same modem AT command string as File 1)
- Register 3331,0: `2A2A2A2A2A00` → `*****` (same as File 1)
- Register 768,0: `34A4F1B3` (different device ID from File 1: `6704EB0F`)
- Register 769,0: `05DF` = 1503 decimal (different from File 1: 11000)
- Register 1024,23: `20` (File 1 has `1F` — a single configuration byte differs)
- Registers 2308, 2309, 2314, 2315: ABSENT (same as File 1)

**Filename analysis:**
- `161` — same script series
- `.32` — version/variant number, one increment above `.31`
- `Rayven` — customer or platform name (Rayven is an IoT platform/data analytics company). Customer identity is inferable from the filename.
- `Demo` — explicitly marks this as a demonstration/pre-sales script
- `DataMono` — references the Monogoto Data SIM / `data.mono` APN
- `Final` — denotes a finalised version
- `.csv` — file format

**Country indicator:** None in filename; directory provides only country context.

**Notable cross-file differences:**
- Primary server (reg 2319): File 1 uses hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`; File 2 uses bare IP `52.164.241.179` (Azure range).
- Device ID (reg 768): Different between files (expected — likely a provisioned device serial).
- Report interval (reg 769): File 1 = 11000; File 2 = 1503.
- Register 1024,23: File 1 = `1F`; File 2 = `20`.
- All connectivity, APN, port, secondary server, and other configuration parameters are identical between the two files.

**No documentation exists** — no README, no changelog, no companion document — anywhere in `UK Script/` or the repository root explaining the UK scripts.

## Findings

**[A19-1]** — HIGH: Demo script (`161.32`) points to a different primary server than the production script (`161.31`) with no documentation explaining why

**Description:** File 1 (`161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv`) uses the hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` as its primary server (register 2319). File 2 (`161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`) uses the bare IP address `52.164.241.179` as its primary server. There is no documentation in either file, in the directory, or in the repository explaining this discrepancy. The hostname in File 1 (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) points to what appears to be a production tracking endpoint for the "CI" customer. The IP in File 2 (`52.164.241.179`) is a routable Azure-range address that also appears in the Australian script set (used for the Komatsu/Rayven production endpoint). It is entirely unclear whether the demo script is: (a) correctly pointed at a Rayven-specific staging server, (b) incorrectly using a Rayven production server, or (c) accidentally re-using an AU production endpoint. Without documentation, a technician cannot determine whether either configuration is correct, intentional, or safe to deploy. The risk is high because deploying the wrong script to a customer device will silently send that device's GPS data to an unintended third-party server.

**Fix:** Add a companion README or header comment in each UK Script CSV documenting: the intended customer, the intended server, and whether the server is production or demo/staging. If `52.164.241.179` in File 2 is a Rayven staging endpoint, say so explicitly. If it is a production endpoint, explain why a demo script is targeting production infrastructure.

---

**[A19-2]** — MEDIUM: No country, carrier, or customer identifier in the filename of File 1 (`161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv`)

**Description:** The filename uses the abbreviation "CI" to identify the customer. "CI" is not a standard abbreviation that can be unambiguously resolved from the filename alone. Unlike File 2 which names the customer "Rayven" in full, File 1 leaves the customer identity ambiguous. The directory name (`UK Script/`) provides the country context, but if the file is moved or shared in isolation it loses even that context. The word "only" in the name is also unexplained — it is unclear what this script is "only" doing vs. a full script, and whether there is a complementary script for the same customer that does more. Additionally, no SIM carrier abbreviation distinguishable from the APN name is present: "Data.Mono" encodes the carrier only if the reader knows that Monogoto's APN is named `data.mono`.

**Fix:** Rename the file to include: (1) the full customer name in place of the abbreviation "CI", (2) a country code (e.g., `UK`), (3) a description of what "only" means (e.g., `CellularOnly` vs. `WiFiEnabled`, or the intended use case). Example: `161.31 UK CustomerName DataMono CellularOnly Final.csv`. Document the customer mapping for "CI" in a repository-level glossary if the abbreviation must be preserved.

---

**[A19-3]** — MEDIUM: Demo script (`161.32`) is marked "Final" despite being a demo-purpose script

**Description:** The filename `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` contains both "Demo" and "Final". This is contradictory documentation: "Demo" implies the script is for pre-sales demonstration purposes (implying it may not be production-ready), while "Final" implies it is a finished, approved version. This ambiguity makes it impossible to determine the lifecycle status of the file — is it a finalised demo script that should never be deployed to production, or is "Final" used to mean it graduated from demo to production? The lack of any accompanying change log or version documentation makes this impossible to resolve from the file content alone.

**Fix:** Adopt a naming convention that clearly separates purpose (production vs. demo vs. test) from lifecycle status (draft vs. review vs. final). For example: `161.32 UK Rayven DataMono Demo-v1.0.csv` makes clear the script is for demo use and tracks its version. Remove the word "Final" from demo scripts entirely to prevent accidental production deployment.

---

**[A19-4]** — MEDIUM: Both UK scripts share all connectivity parameters (APN, port, secondary server) with no documentation of whether this is intentional

**Description:** Both `161.31` and `161.32` use identical values for: APN (`data.mono`), server port (20500), secondary server (`dm.calamp.co.uk`), heartbeat interval (86400 seconds), and modem AT command string (`<EA><S0><=*><T1>`). The two scripts differ only in primary server, device ID, report interval, and one configuration byte. There is no documentation explaining whether the shared parameters are a deliberate design choice (a common base configuration for all UK Monogoto deployments) or whether one of the files was copied from the other and is missing customer-specific customisation. Without this documentation, a reviewer cannot determine whether these scripts are correctly configured for their respective customers and purposes.

**Fix:** Add a short comment block at the top of each CSV (using a dedicated `#`-prefixed comment row that the CalAmp tooling ignores, if supported, or a companion `.txt` file alongside each CSV) explaining: (a) which parameters are shared across the UK base configuration and intentionally identical, (b) which parameters are customer-specific and should differ between scripts, and (c) the expected value range or justification for each customer-specific parameter.

---

**[A19-5]** — MEDIUM: No documentation for the primary server hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` in File 1

**Description:** Register 2319,0 in `161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv` decodes to the hostname `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`. This is a subdomain (`narhm`) under the domain `tracking-intelligence.com`. There is no documentation in the repository explaining: what `narhm` stands for (it is not obviously related to the customer abbreviation "CI"), who operates the `tracking-intelligence.com` domain, whether this is a CalAmp-operated endpoint, the customer's own server, or a third-party platform server. The subdomain prefix `narhm` is particularly opaque. If the subdomain is customer-specific and the domain is a third-party platform (similar to how `52.164.241.179` corresponds to a Rayven platform endpoint), then the device data is being sent to a third-party system and this should be clearly documented for data-flow and privacy compliance purposes.

**Fix:** Document in a README or companion file: (1) who owns and operates `tracking-intelligence.com`, (2) what the `narhm` subdomain represents (customer subdomain, device group, etc.), (3) whether this constitutes a third-party data processor relationship requiring GDPR or contractual documentation, and (4) the expected port and protocol for this endpoint (the file shows port 20500 in register 2311).

---

**[A19-6]** — LOW: No inline documentation in either UK Script CSV file

**Description:** Neither `161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv` nor `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` contains any human-readable commentary within the file body. The only text structure is the column header row (`parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`). There are no comment lines explaining the script's purpose, the customer it is for, the device model it targets, the date it was created, the author who created it, or the relationship between the two UK scripts. A technician opening either file for the first time has no in-file guidance to understand what the script configures or whether it is appropriate for their use case.

**Fix:** Adopt a convention of adding a comment block at the top of each script. If the CalAmp CSV format does not support comment rows (lines beginning with `#`), maintain a companion `_README.txt` or `_NOTES.md` file in the `UK Script/` directory containing a table mapping each filename to: customer name, device model, SIM carrier, primary server, purpose (production/demo/test), version history, and author/date.

---

**[A19-7]** — LOW: Register 3331 value `*****` present in both UK files — purpose undocumented

**Description:** Register 3331,0 in both files decodes to `2A2A2A2A2A00`, which is five ASCII asterisk characters followed by a null terminator (`*****`). The same value was observed in the Australian script files audited in Pass 1. No CalAmp documentation or repository-level explanation for this register has been located. The five-asterisk pattern is a well-known visual masking placeholder in GUI configuration tools (displayed when a hidden/password field is set). If the device firmware receives `*****` as a literal value for register 3331, then all devices programmed with this script share the same five-character default credential/value, which is trivially guessable. If it is a GUI placeholder that is substituted with a real value at programming time, there is no documentation of that substitution process. Either way, the lack of documentation for this register creates an unresolved risk.

**Fix:** Determine the purpose of register 3331 from CalAmp LMU firmware documentation. If it is a security-sensitive field (password, PIN, or authentication token), determine whether `*****` is being written literally to devices and, if so, replace it with a unique per-deployment value. If `*****` is a GUI placeholder, document that substitution explicitly in the provisioning procedure so that the configuration tool's actual substituted value is auditable.

---

**[A19-8]** — LOW: No version control or change history evident in either UK Script file

**Description:** Both files are named with the word "Final" but there are no version numbers beyond the `.31` and `.32` series prefix inherited from the filename convention. There is no creation date, modification date, or author attribution in either file. The git history provides some implicit versioning (commit timestamps and messages), but the file content itself carries no version metadata. If a file is exported from the repository, renamed, or copied, all version context is lost. The `.31` and `.32` numbering suggests a sequential increment, but it is not documented whether this represents a major revision, a minor tweak, or simply script numbering within a batch.

**Fix:** Add a version metadata block to each script (in a companion file if the CSV format does not support comments), recording: script number, semantic version (major.minor), date of last change, author, and a brief description of what changed from the previous version. Consider adopting semantic versioning in the filename (e.g., `161.31-v1.2 UK CustomerName DataMono Final.csv`) to make version history unambiguous without relying solely on git history.

---

**[A19-9]** — LOW: No documentation distinguishing `161.31` from `161.32` beyond filename tokens

**Description:** The two UK Script files differ in primary server endpoint, device ID, report interval, and one configuration byte. The filenames suggest they serve different customers or purposes ("CI only" vs. "Rayven Demo"), but there is no documentation explaining: (a) why both are in the same `UK Script/` directory, (b) how they relate to each other (are they derived from a common base? is one a fork of the other?), (c) whether both are actively used, or (d) whether one supersedes the other. A new team member or external auditor cannot reconstruct the design decisions that produced these two nearly identical scripts from the files alone.

**Fix:** Create a `UK Script/README.md` (or equivalent) that describes each script in the directory, explains the customer or purpose it serves, documents the key differences between scripts, and provides guidance on which script should be used in which scenario. At minimum, document the relationship between `161.31` and `161.32` so that the correct script is always selected for the correct deployment.

---

**[A19-10]** — INFO: APN credentials absent in both UK files; reliance on SIM-based authentication is undocumented

**Description:** Registers 2314 (APN username) and 2315 (APN password) are not present in either UK Script file. The APN `data.mono` (Monogoto) is used without username/password authentication. This is consistent with the AU scripts (which also omit these registers), suggesting that Monogoto's `data.mono` APN relies on SIM IMSI/ICCID authentication rather than PAP/CHAP credentials. While this is a valid configuration for IoT-grade SIM deployments, the absence of any documentation confirming that SIM-level authentication is enforced means that an auditor cannot confirm whether the APN is protected against unauthorised SIM usage.

**Fix:** Add a note in the UK Script directory documentation confirming that the Monogoto `data.mono` APN uses SIM-based IMSI/ICCID authentication (not PAP/CHAP), and confirming that unauthorised SIMs cannot access the APN. If this has been confirmed with the Monogoto account manager, record the confirmation date and reference.
