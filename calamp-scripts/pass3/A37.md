## Reading Evidence

**Assigned file:** `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/US Script/SIE/69.006 Rayven SIE Datamono Final.csv`

**Confirmation method:** Glob of `US Script/*.csv` returned 10 files across subdirectories; last alphabetically (by full path including subdirectory) is the SIE file. This matches the Pass 1 assignment recorded in A37.md.

**File statistics:**
- Total lines: 1229 (wc -l; file does not end with a trailing newline on line 1230)
- Header row: Line 1 — `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`
- Data rows: 1228 data rows (lines 2–1229)
- Empty/comment rows: None

**Unique parameter IDs (90 distinct register numbers):**
256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 283, 285, 286, 291, 512, 513, 515, 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 779, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 913, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1037, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1056, 1280, 1281, 1282, 1283, 1536, 1537, 1538, 1539, 1540, 2178, 2306, 2307, 2312, 2313, 2318, 2319, 2327, 3072, 3073, 3074, 3328, 3329, 3330, 3331, 3332, 3333

**Header/comment rows present:** One standard CSV header row (`parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`) on line 1. No comment rows. No human-readable description rows. No script-level metadata embedded in the file.

**Notable registers (decoded from Pass 1 analysis):**
- 2306,0 and 2306,1: APN = `data.mono` (Datamono SIM provider)
- 2319,0: Primary server IP = `52.164.241.179`
- 2318,0: USSD code = `*22899`
- 3331,0: Masked value = `*****`
- 2178,0: Message template = `<EA><S0><=*><T1>`

**Cross-reference — SIE scripts in other directories:**
- `UK Script/`: No SIE subfolder. Contains 2 files (161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final, 161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final). No SIE content.
- `Aus Script/`: No SIE subfolder. Contains Boaroo, CEA, DPWorld, Keller, Komatsu_AU subdirectories plus one general CSV. No SIE content.
- `8bit Script/`: No SIE content. Contains two LMU1220 POD scripts.
- `Demo Script/`: No SIE content. Contains one demo DataMono script.
- `US Script/`: SIE subfolder contains exactly one file — the file under review.

**Conclusion:** The SIE script is a singleton. There is no corresponding SIE script in any other regional directory and no version history is visible from the file tree (only one SIE CSV exists across the entire repository).

## Findings

**[A37-D1]** — HIGH: No inline documentation — file contains zero explanatory comments

**Description:** The CSV file contains 1228 data rows and one column-header row but no comment lines, no script-description block, and no purpose statement anywhere in the file. A reviewer opening the file has no way to understand from its contents alone what the script configures, which device model it targets, or what business function it serves. The CalAmp CSV format does not natively support comment syntax, but the absence of any documentation wrapper (e.g., a companion README, a header block in an adjacent file, or a convention such as a dedicated `#`-prefixed comment row) means the file is entirely self-opaque. All other script families in the repository (Matthai, PAPE) suffer the same gap, but the SIE file is the sole representative of its customer and therefore has no peer scripts to provide context by analogy.

**Fix:** Create a companion `README.txt` or `README.md` in the `US Script/SIE/` directory explaining: (1) what device model this script targets, (2) what the script enables/configures at a functional level, (3) the SIM provider (Datamono), (4) the server endpoint and its role, and (5) any customer-specific requirements that drove configuration choices. Alternatively, adopt a repository-wide convention of a companion sidecar file (e.g., `69.006 Rayven SIE Datamono Final.notes.txt`) placed alongside each CSV.

**[A37-D2]** — HIGH: No register documentation — 90 parameter IDs are undocumented within the repository

**Description:** The file uses 90 distinct parameter IDs. None of these registers are documented anywhere in the repository. The README references a "registers" document ("it should be register in the 'registers'") but no such document exists in the repository — no registers spreadsheet, glossary, or reference file is present. Without register documentation, a maintainer cannot determine what any given parameter ID controls, what the legal value range is, what the default value is, or what security implications a given register's value carries. This gap was directly observed during Pass 1: registers such as 3331, 2178, 2312, 2313, 2318, and the entire 512-series required external reverse-engineering to interpret. The README's broken reference to a "registers" document indicates the documentation was either never created or was not committed to the repository.

**Fix:** Create and commit a register reference document (CSV, spreadsheet, or Markdown table) that maps each parameter ID used across all scripts to: register name, description, value format, known values, and security classification (e.g., "contains server address", "contains credential", "contains APN"). The LMU Manager application presumably ships with or references official CalAmp register documentation — that reference should be linked or summarised in the repository. At minimum, the registers referenced in the README must be created and committed.

---

**[A37-D3]** — HIGH: README references non-existent "registers" document

**Description:** The repository README states: "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'". This is the only attempt at a documentation standard in the repository, and it refers to a "registers" artefact that does not exist anywhere in the repository. The root directory contains only `README.md` and `URL & PORTS.xlsx`; there is no file matching "registers" in any form (no `registers.csv`, `registers.xlsx`, `registers.md`, or similarly named file). This means the stated process for script governance — version naming and registration — cannot be followed and cannot be verified.

**Fix:** Either create the "registers" tracking document and commit it (ideally as a version-controlled file, not only as an off-repo spreadsheet), or update the README to accurately describe where the register tracking lives and how to access it. If the document exists externally (e.g., in a shared drive or wiki), add a direct link.

**[A37-D4]** — MEDIUM: Filename does not encode script version, only a version number prefix

**Description:** The filename `69.006 Rayven SIE Datamono Final.csv` encodes several useful tokens: `69.006` (a version/revision number), `Rayven` (the platform/integrator), `SIE` (the customer), `Datamono` (the SIM carrier/APN type), and `Final` (a lifecycle state). However, the meaning of the `69.006` numeric prefix is not documented anywhere. It is not clear whether this is a semantic version (major.minor), a sequential script number, a device firmware compatibility code, or an internal ticket/task number. The `Final` suffix also lacks precision: there is no date stamp, no change description, and no indication of what changed from a prior version (if one exists). The word "Final" is not a reliable version designator in a repository with potential future revisions.

**Fix:** Establish and document a filename convention that includes: customer code, SIM/carrier type, device model or firmware version, a semantic version or date stamp, and a change summary token. For example: `SIE-DataMono-LMU3030-v1.0.0-2024MMDD.csv`. Replace or augment the use of `Final` with a date or semantic version. Document the filename convention in the README so all contributors follow it.

---

**[A37-D5]** — MEDIUM: Country not encoded in filename or path for the SIE script

**Description:** The README states scripts are "divided based on country." The directory path `US Script/SIE/` implicitly encodes the country (United States), but the filename itself (`69.006 Rayven SIE Datamono Final.csv`) does not contain a country token. If this file were ever moved, copied, or referenced outside its directory context, there would be no country indicator in the filename. Other files in the repository partially encode country (e.g., UK Script files include no country code in filenames either, making this a repository-wide gap, but the SIE script is the only one in its directory and thus has no peer for disambiguation).

**Fix:** Add a country or region code to the filename as part of the naming convention. For example: `69.006 Rayven SIE US Datamono Final.csv` or, with the improved convention proposed in D4, `SIE-US-DataMono-LMU3030-v1.0.0.csv`.

---

**[A37-D6]** — MEDIUM: No documentation explaining the SIE customer relationship or requirements

**Description:** "SIE" appears as a directory name and customer token, but nothing in the repository explains who or what SIE is, why they have their own script, what their operational requirements are, or how their configuration differs from the Matthai and PAPE families. From Pass 1 analysis, the SIE script is structurally very similar to the Matthai DataMono scripts (same APN `data.mono`, same server IP `52.164.241.179`, same masked register 3331 value), suggesting it may be a near-clone with minor or no meaningful differences. Without documentation, it is impossible to determine: (a) whether SIE intentionally differs from Matthai DataMono or was simply copied; (b) what SIE-specific requirements drove any differences; (c) whether the SIE configuration is still maintained or is stale.

**Fix:** Add a `README.md` or `CUSTOMER.md` in `US Script/SIE/` describing the SIE customer, the purpose of this script family, known differences from other customer scripts, and the date of last review. Note whether the configuration was independently designed for SIE or derived from another customer's script.

**[A37-D7]** — MEDIUM: Single script for SIE customer — no variant documentation, no deprecation policy

**Description:** The `US Script/SIE/` directory contains exactly one CSV file. Other customer directories contain multiple variants (PAPE has 6 scripts across different SIM types and firmware versions; Matthai has 3). The singleton nature of the SIE directory raises documentation questions: Is this the only SIE configuration ever created? Have previous versions been deleted rather than retained? Is there only one SIE device type in the field? Are there no SIM alternatives for SIE? Without documentation, there is no way to answer these questions. The absence of version history in the file tree also means that if the script was ever updated, prior versions are inaccessible (assuming no external archiving exists).

**Fix:** Document the rationale for the single-file SIE directory. If prior versions exist externally, link to them or commit them with clear version markers. Establish a retention policy for superseded script versions (e.g., keep last N versions in the directory with a `DEPRECATED` or `ARCHIVED` suffix). If SIE genuinely requires only one configuration, document that decision explicitly.

---

**[A37-D8]** — MEDIUM: No documentation for register 3331 masked value — cannot verify intent

**Description:** Register 3331,0 is set to `2A2A2A2A2A00` which decodes to `*****`. The same pattern appears in all US script families (PAPE, Matthai, SIE). There is no documentation anywhere in the repository explaining what register 3331 controls, what the actual value should be, or whether `*****` is intentionally committed as a placeholder (with the real value provisioned separately) or whether `*****` is a literal intended value. If `*****` is a placeholder substituted before committing to protect a credential, there must be documentation of the secure provisioning channel through which the real value reaches the device. If `*****` is the literal intended value, that also requires documentation since an asterisk-only string in what may be a PIN/password field is anomalous.

**Fix:** Document register 3331's function and the intended value for SIE devices. If the asterisks represent a redacted credential, document the provisioning workflow (e.g., "real value is injected at deployment time via X process"). If `*****` is the literal value, confirm this is the device's expected input and document why.

---

**[A37-D9]** — LOW: URL & PORTS.xlsx exists at repository root but is not linked or referenced for SIE

**Description:** The repository root contains `URL & PORTS.xlsx`, which likely documents server endpoints and ports used across all customer scripts. However, the README does not describe this file's purpose, its relationship to individual scripts, or whether it covers SIE. There is no reference from the SIE directory to this file. If this spreadsheet does document the server IP `52.164.241.179` and associated ports, it partially fulfils the register endpoint documentation gap — but its binary format (`.xlsx`) is not version-control-friendly, its contents are not visible in git diffs, and there is no evidence it is kept current with script changes.

**Fix:** Convert the URL and ports documentation to a plain-text or Markdown format so it can be meaningfully version-controlled and diffed. Explicitly reference it from the README and from per-customer directories. Confirm that SIE's server endpoint and port configuration is covered in this document, and that it is updated whenever a script changes a server register value.

---

**[A37-D10]** — LOW: README contact is a single named individual — bus factor risk for documentation

**Description:** The README's "Who do I talk to?" section lists one person: "Rhythm Duwadi." All script creation, modification, and interpretation knowledge appears to be centralised in a single individual. If that person is unavailable, there is no fallback contact, no documentation of the decision rationale behind any script, and no institutional knowledge captured in the repository. This is a documentation governance risk: the repository's entire interpretive context depends on one person's memory.

**Fix:** Expand the contact section to include at minimum a team or role email address in addition to or instead of an individual name. Document key decisions (customer configurations, SIM choices, server endpoints) in the repository itself so knowledge is not held exclusively by one person. Consider a CODEOWNERS file to designate review responsibilities.

---

**[A37-D11]** — INFO: `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value` header row present — partial documentation credit

**Description:** The file does include a CSV header row on line 1 with column names `parameter_id`, `parameter_index`, `parameter_value`. This provides minimal structural documentation and makes the file machine-parseable with standard CSV tooling. It is the only in-file documentation present.

**Fix:** No fix required for the header row itself. Note for completeness: the header names are generic CalAmp field names and do not contain any script-specific metadata. This finding is informational only.
