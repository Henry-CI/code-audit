## Findings

**[A27-1]** — HIGH: No README or file-level documentation explaining the purpose of URL & PORTS.xlsx

**Description:** There is no documentation anywhere in the repository that explains what `URL & PORTS.xlsx` is, why it exists, who is responsible for maintaining it, or how it relates to the CSV scripts in the repo. The root-level `README.md` mentions a vague "registers" concept ("it should be register in the 'registers'") but never names or describes `URL & PORTS.xlsx`. A reader encountering this file has no authoritative explanation of its role.

**Fix:** Add a section to `README.md` (or a dedicated `CONTRIBUTING.md`) that explicitly identifies `URL & PORTS.xlsx` as the network endpoint reference document, describes its purpose (mapping customer names to inbound URL/IP and port assignments for Rayven and CI), names the current maintainer, and explains when and how it must be updated.

---

**[A27-2]** — HIGH: No documentation on the relationship between spreadsheet rows and CSV script files

**Description:** The spreadsheet lists 34 customers with inbound URLs and port assignments, but nowhere — not in the spreadsheet, not in the README, not in any other file — is there a documented mapping between a spreadsheet row and the specific CSV script file(s) that use those values. For example, there is no indication that the "PAPE" row corresponds to `US Script/PAPE/62.134 Rayven CI PAPE Final Datamono.csv` or any of the other five PAPE CSV files. This makes it impossible to audit whether all scripts are accounted for, or to trace a port change back to the correct script.

**Fix:** Add a "Script File" or "Related CSV" column to the spreadsheet, or create a separate mapping document, that links each customer row to the specific CSV file(s) in the repository that encode those endpoint values. At minimum, annotate the README with a cross-reference table.

---

**[A27-3]** — MEDIUM: Column headers are present but "Port" and "Port2" are undocumented and ambiguous

**Description:** The six column headers are: Customer, Type of Device, Rayven Inbound URL, Port, CI Inbound URL, Port2. The distinction between "Port" and "Port2" is not explained. From the data, "Port" appears to carry the device-facing inbound port (e.g. 1500–1515 for CALAMP, 16005–16026 for G70) while "Port2" appears to carry the CI outbound or secondary port (11000). However this interpretation is inferred only from data inspection; there is no label, comment, or documentation explaining what each port column means, the direction of traffic, or which system uses each value.

**Fix:** Rename "Port2" to a descriptive name (e.g. "CI Inbound Port") and add a column-definition comment or a legend row/tab in the spreadsheet explaining what each column represents, the direction of the connection, and which device or system reads that value.

---

**[A27-4]** — MEDIUM: Multi-row customer entries lack intra-row context — row grouping is undocumented

**Description:** Several customers span multiple rows with no explicit grouping indicator. For example, Komatsu Forklift Australia occupies rows 3 and 4, where row 3 carries CALAMP device data and row 4 carries G70 device data. The same customer name is not repeated on the continuation row, and there is no "Group" column, merge indicator, or legend explaining the multi-row pattern. A reader who starts reading at row 4 has no way to know which customer it belongs to.

**Fix:** Either repeat the customer name on every row, use Excel cell-merging with a documented convention, add an explicit "Group/Customer ID" column, or add a note/legend tab explaining the multi-row structure. A short note in the README describing the pattern would also be sufficient.

---

**[A27-5]** — MEDIUM: No maintenance documentation — no process defined for updating the file when scripts change

**Description:** There is no documented procedure for when and how `URL & PORTS.xlsx` should be updated. The README says new scripts "should be register in the 'registers'" but never explains what constitutes a register update, who must approve it, or what steps to follow. There is no checklist, no workflow description, and no indication of whether the spreadsheet is treated as the source of truth (scripts derive from it) or as a derived record (it is updated after scripts are created).

**Fix:** Document in the README (or a CONTRIBUTING file) the maintenance workflow: (1) who approves new endpoint assignments, (2) whether the spreadsheet is updated before or after the CSV script is created, (3) who must be notified when an entry changes, and (4) how stale entries for decommissioned customers are handled.

---

**[A27-6]** — HIGH: No access control documentation — file contains live network infrastructure data (IPs and ports) with no access guidance

**Description:** `URL & PORTS.xlsx` contains production IP addresses (52.164.241.179, 52.169.16.32, 103.4.235.15), a production DNS hostname (narhm.tracking-intelligence.com), and the specific inbound port assignments for 34 customer tenants. This is sensitive network infrastructure data. The file is stored in a Git repository with no documented access control policy: there is no statement of who is permitted to view it, no indication that the repository should be private, and no guidance on handling the file outside of the repository (e.g. in email, tickets, or shared drives).

**Fix:** Add an access control statement to the README or a separate SECURITY.md file specifying: (1) this repository must remain private / restricted, (2) the file should not be shared outside of authorised staff, (3) the IP addresses and ports are production infrastructure data and any exposure should be treated as a security incident. Consider whether the IP addresses and ports should be moved out of a public or broadly-accessible Git repository and stored in a secrets management system or internal wiki with proper ACLs.

---

**[A27-7]** — MEDIUM: No version history or last-updated date documented within the spreadsheet itself

**Description:** The OOXML metadata records a last-modified timestamp of 2024-11-14T22:59:52Z and a creation date of 2015-06-05T18:17:20Z (both embedded in `docProps/core.xml`), but these are hidden file-system-level properties not visible to a spreadsheet user. There is no version number, no change log tab, no "last updated" cell, and no changelog entry in the repository commit history that correlates changes to the spreadsheet with the addition or modification of specific customer rows or port assignments. The file has been in use for approximately 9 years with no auditable history of who changed what and when.

**Fix:** Add a "Change Log" tab or a "Last Updated / Version" row at the top of the spreadsheet recording the date, author, and nature of each change. Alternatively (or additionally), ensure that every commit touching `URL & PORTS.xlsx` includes a meaningful commit message describing which customer entry was added, changed, or removed.

---

**[A27-8]** — LOW: Spreadsheet has a data quality issue — "G70 " (index 19) contains a trailing space, and port 16026 is duplicated across two different customers

**Description:** Shared string index 19 is "G70 " (with a trailing space) used for the "Material Handling INC" row, while all other G70 entries use "G70" (no space, index 11). This inconsistency is a data entry error that is invisible to a casual user but would cause a programmatic lookup by device type to fail for that row. Additionally, port 16026 is assigned to both "Kion Group" (row 59) and "Kion Asia" (row 65), which may be intentional (same group) or may be a data entry mistake; there is no documentation clarifying whether port sharing between tenants is permitted.

**Fix:** Correct the trailing space on "G70 " for the Material Handling INC row. Document whether port sharing between customer rows is intentional (e.g. by adding a "Notes" column) and if not, assign Kion Asia a unique port.

---

**[A27-9]** — LOW: The spreadsheet worksheet is named "Sheet1" — no descriptive tab name

**Description:** The single worksheet is named "Sheet1" (the Excel default). This provides no context about the content to a user who opens the file.

**Fix:** Rename the worksheet tab to a descriptive name such as "Customer Endpoints" or "URL and Port Registry" to make the file's purpose immediately visible when opened.

---

**[A27-10]** — INFO: File creator identity is recorded in metadata but is not surfaced in the spreadsheet or README

**Description:** The OOXML `docProps/core.xml` records the creator as "Rhythm Duwadi" and the last modifier as "Rhythm Duwadi". This is consistent with the README's "Who do I talk to?" section which also names Rhythm Duwadi. However, this information is not duplicated inside the spreadsheet itself (no "Maintainer" cell or tab), so if the README is updated without updating the file metadata, or vice versa, ownership information will diverge.

**Fix:** Consider adding a visible "Maintainer" or "Owner" field somewhere in the spreadsheet (e.g. a dedicated cell above the table or a metadata tab) so ownership is self-documenting without requiring external reference to README or file properties.
