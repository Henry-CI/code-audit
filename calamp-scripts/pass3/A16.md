# Pass 3 Documentation — Agent A16
**Files:** UK Script/ (first batch)
**Branch:** main
**Date:** 2026-02-28

## Scope Note

The glob `C:/Projects/cig-audit/repos/calamp-scripts/UK Script/*.csv` returns exactly two files:

1. `161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv`
2. `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`

With only two files in the directory, the "first third" resolves to one file (file 1) under a strict interpretation, but both files are covered here because: (a) the total directory population is only 2 files, (b) they share the same structural and documentation deficiencies, and (c) a batch finding covering both is the most useful result. All findings below apply to both files unless otherwise stated.

## Reading Evidence

### FILE 1: `UK Script/161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv`

**Filename analysis:**
- `161.31` — numeric prefix; no version scheme is documented anywhere; the meaning of `161` and `.31` is unknown without external reference
- `CI only` — suggests "CalAmp/Customer Integration only" or possibly "CI" as a vendor/system abbreviation; not explained in the file or in the README
- `Data.Mono` — identifies the SIM carrier APN as `data.mono` (Telstra Data.Mono or a similar mono-SIM APN for the UK context; verified against register 2306 content below)
- `Final` — implies this is a production-ready revision, but there is no version number, date stamp, or revision history
- Country not stated in filename; directory name "UK Script" provides implicit region, but no UK carrier name is present
- Customer not stated in filename

**Row count:** 1235 data rows + 1 structural header row = 1236 total lines

**Header / comment rows:** One header row: `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`. This is a structural CSV column header only. There are no comment rows, no description rows, no authorship rows, and no purpose rows anywhere in the file.

**Unique parameter IDs present (base IDs):**
256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 283, 285, 286, 291, 512, 513, 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 779, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 913, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1037, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1056, 1280, 1281, 1282, 1283, 1536, 1537, 1539, 1540, 2176, 2178, 2306, 2307, 2311, 2312, 2313, 2319, 2320, 2322, 2327, 3072, 3073, 3074, 3328, 3329, 3330, 3331, 3332, 3333

**Selected register decodes:**
- `2306,0` and `2306,1`: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` = `data.mono` (APN, both primary and secondary slots)
- `2319,0`: `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` = `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (primary server FQDN)
- `2320,0`: `646D2E63616C616D702E636F2E756B00` = `dm.calamp.co.uk` (secondary/fallback server FQDN)
- `2311,0`: `5014` hex = 20500 decimal (port)
- `2312,0`: `0011` hex = 17 decimal (port-family / protocol selector register)
- `2178,0`: `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` = `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` (CalAmp event/report format template string)
- `3331,0`: `2A2A2A2A2A00` = `*****` (masked five-character value)
- `768,0`: `6704EB0F` (device-specific seed or unit ID; varies per file)
- Registers 2308, 2309, 2314, 2315, 2318 are all absent from this file.

---

### FILE 2: `UK Script/161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv`

**Filename analysis:**
- `161.32` — same numeric prefix family as file 1; `.32` increment suggests a variant or newer revision of `.31`, but no changelog or version document exists
- `Rayven Demo` — names the target platform (Rayven) and use case (Demo), distinguishing it from the CI-only script; however "Demo" is not defined (demo for which customer? demo environment vs. production?)
- `DataMono` — same APN family as file 1 (confirmed by register 2306 content below)
- `Final` — same qualifier as file 1; no date or version number appended
- Country: implied by directory only
- Customer: "Rayven" is identifiable as a software platform name; the end customer using Rayven is not identified

**Row count:** 1235 data rows + 1 structural header row = 1236 total lines

**Header / comment rows:** One header row: `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`. Identical situation to file 1 — no descriptive content.

**Unique parameter IDs present:** Identical set to file 1.

**Selected register decodes:**
- `2306,0` and `2306,1`: `646174612E6D6F6E6F00` = `data.mono` (same APN as file 1)
- `2319,0`: `35322E3136342E3234312E31373900` = `52.164.241.179` (primary server as raw IP — differs from file 1 which uses FQDN `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`)
- `2320,0`: `646D2E63616C616D702E636F2E756B00` = `dm.calamp.co.uk` (same secondary server as file 1)
- `2311,0`: `5014` = 20500 decimal (same port as file 1)
- `2312,0`: `0011` = 17 decimal (same)
- `2178,0`: `3C45413E3C53303E3C3D2A3E3C54313E00` = `<EA><S0><=*><T1>` (same template string as file 1)
- `3331,0`: `2A2A2A2A2A00` = `*****` (same as file 1)
- `768,0`: `34A4F1B3` (different from file 1 value `6704EB0F`)
- `1024,23`: `20` hex = 32 decimal (vs. `1F` = 31 decimal in file 1 — the one substantive parameter difference between the two files)

**Difference between the two files:** The only substantive parameter difference identified is `1024,23` (motion/accelerometer threshold or sensitivity register — value 31 in file 1, 32 in file 2) and `2319,0` (primary server: FQDN in file 1, raw IP in file 2). Register `768,0` also differs but this is likely a device-specific seed. These differences are not documented anywhere.

## Findings

**[A16-1]** — HIGH: No inline documentation in either file; parameter IDs are entirely undocumented within the scripts

**Description:** Neither `161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv` nor `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` contains any comment rows, purpose header, or descriptive metadata beyond the structural CSV column header `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`. A reader opening either file has no way to determine: (a) what the script is intended to configure, (b) which customer or deployment it targets, (c) what register IDs mean (e.g., what 2319 or 3331 control), (d) who authored or last modified the script, or (e) what the intended outcome of applying the script is. The CSV format does not natively support comment rows, but CalAmp LMU Manager scripts have been observed across this repository to uniformly lack any documentation mechanism. There is no companion document, no README within the `UK Script/` subdirectory, and no per-file changelog. The root README.md mentions a "registers" reference but provides no link or location for it. This means that anyone maintaining, troubleshooting, or auditing these scripts must either possess external tribal knowledge or reverse-engineer register meanings from CalAmp hardware manuals — if those are even accessible. In a production operational context this constitutes a maintainability and auditability risk: the scripts cannot be reviewed, validated, or safely modified without undocumented external context.

**Fix:** Add a companion `UK Script/README.md` that: (1) lists each file with customer name, SIM carrier, purpose, and version; (2) links to or embeds a register ID reference (even a minimal one covering the registers actually used in these scripts); and (3) defines the naming convention used (what `161.xx` means, what `Final` signifies, and what the `CI only` / `Rayven Demo` prefixes indicate). Additionally, establish a policy that any new script must have a corresponding entry in this companion document before it is committed to the repository.

---

**[A16-2]** — MEDIUM: Filename version scheme is opaque and not documented

**Description:** Both files use a numeric prefix scheme (`161.31`, `161.32`) that implies a structured version or script catalogue number, but this scheme is undefined anywhere in the repository. The root README.md states "it should be register in the 'registers'" for new scripts but provides no location for that register and no example of what the numbering means. Consequences include: it is impossible to determine which script is the most current for a given deployment by inspecting filenames alone; the relationship between `161.31` and `161.32` is not self-evident (are they variants of the same base script? a numbered sequence? customer-specific variants?); and the word `Final` in both filenames conveys no version progression — if a new revision is needed, a maintainer has no clear guidance on what to name it. Furthermore, the one observable parameter difference between the two files (primary server FQDN vs. IP in register 2319, and a single motion-threshold register value) is not reflected in the filenames at all.

**Fix:** Define and document the numbering convention in the root README.md or in a `UK Script/README.md`. At minimum, document: what the `161` prefix represents, what the `.31` / `.32` suffixes represent, whether `Final` is a state (production-ready) or a version label, and what the expected naming pattern for future revisions is (e.g., `161.33` or `161.31-v2`). Consider replacing or supplementing the numeric suffix with a date stamp or semantic version.

---

**[A16-3]** — MEDIUM: Customer identity is not reliably documented in filenames or file content

**Description:** File `161.31 CI only Data.Mono Final.csv` contains the token `CI only`, which likely refers to a CalAmp integration or a specific customer/system integration. The customer or end-user of this script is not named. File `161.32 Rayven Demo DataMono Final.csv` names `Rayven` (a platform) but not the end customer deploying Rayven. Neither file contains any field, comment, or metadata row identifying the customer. The root README.md explains that scripts are divided by country and SIM carrier, but does not mention customer-level identification. In a repository serving multiple customers (as evidenced by the `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/` directory structure using a customer subdirectory), the `UK Script/` directory has no customer-level organisation. If more UK scripts are added for different customers, they will be intermixed with no clear separation. The server endpoint in `161.31` (`narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`) does provide an implicit pointer to a customer or platform (`tracking-intelligence.com` / `narhm` subdomain), but this is embedded configuration, not documentation.

**Fix:** Either: (a) restructure `UK Script/` to use customer subdirectories (analogous to `Aus Script/Komatsu_AU/`), placing customer-specific scripts within named folders; or (b) add a `UK Script/README.md` that maps each filename to its intended customer, deployment context, and SIM carrier. In the near term, rename or prefix files to include the customer name (e.g., `161.31 TrackingIntelligence CI Data.Mono Final.csv`).

**[A16-4]** — MEDIUM: The difference between the two UK scripts is not documented

**Description:** The two files in `UK Script/` are closely related — they share identical structure, identical APN configuration, identical port and protocol settings, and the vast majority of parameter values. They differ in: (1) register `2319,0` — file 161.31 uses the FQDN `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` as the primary server while file 161.32 uses the raw IP `52.164.241.179`; (2) register `1024,23` — value 31 (0x1F) in file 161.31 vs. 32 (0x20) in file 161.32; (3) register `768,0` — different device-seed values. None of these differences are documented anywhere. A maintainer applying one of these scripts to a device instead of the other would silently configure different server addressing and potentially different motion detection behaviour. The filenames (`CI only` vs. `Rayven Demo`) suggest different deployment targets, but it is not clear whether the FQDN vs. IP difference is intentional (e.g., the Demo environment resolves by IP while production uses DNS) or an oversight. This ambiguity creates a risk of misconfiguration in production.

**Fix:** Add a document (or section in `UK Script/README.md`) that explicitly states the intended differences between `161.31` and `161.32`, particularly: (a) the rationale for using the FQDN vs. the IP address in register 2319 and whether each is appropriate for its target environment; (b) the meaning and intended value of register `1024,23` and why the two files differ by one unit; and (c) the purpose of register `768,0` and whether the per-file variation is intentional or a device-provisioning artefact.

---

**[A16-5]** — LOW: No per-file register reference or companion documentation; the root README's "registers" reference is broken

**Description:** The root `README.md` states "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'". This refers to an external "registers" document (presumably a register ID reference or a script catalogue), but no such document exists anywhere in the repository. There is no `registers` file, no register reference spreadsheet, and no link to an external system. The `URL & PORTS.xlsx` file exists at the root but its contents are not verified in this pass. The absence of any register reference means that the ~90 distinct parameter IDs used in these scripts (IDs in ranges 256-291, 512-513, 768-779, 902-913, 1024-1056, 1280-1283, 1536-1540, 2176-2327, 3072-3074, 3328-3333) have no in-repository documentation of their meaning, valid range, or expected values.

**Fix:** Create the "registers" document referenced in the README. At minimum it should be a Markdown or CSV file mapping each parameter ID used across the repository to: its human-readable name, a brief description of what it controls, its value type (hex string, integer, ASCII-encoded string, etc.), and valid range or known values. This document should be linked from the root README and from any per-directory README files.

---

**[A16-6]** — LOW: No authorship, date, or change history metadata in any UK Script file

**Description:** Neither file contains any indicator of when it was created, who created it, when it was last modified, or what changes were made in this version compared to a prior version. Git commit history provides some implicit authorship (commits attributed to committer identity), but commit messages in this repository (e.g., "Do it", "Files added for PAPE with Rayven in index 0") do not describe what changed within individual scripts or why. For a fleet device configuration repository where incorrect scripts could be pushed to physical hardware, the inability to trace "who changed what and why" on a per-script basis creates an accountability and incident-response gap.

**Fix:** Establish a lightweight convention for change tracking. Options include: (a) adding a header comment block at the top of each CSV (using a dummy parameter ID that CalAmp LMU Manager ignores, if any exist, or a separate companion `.txt` file per script); (b) maintaining a `CHANGELOG.md` in `UK Script/` with per-file revision entries; or (c) enforcing a git commit message convention that requires the script filename and a brief description of the change to be included in every commit touching a script file.

**[A16-7]** — INFO: Secondary server `dm.calamp.co.uk` present in both files with no documentation of its role

**Description:** Register `2320,0` in both files decodes to `dm.calamp.co.uk`, which is a CalAmp-operated device management domain. This is present as a secondary/fallback server endpoint in both UK scripts. Its role (whether it is a fallback data endpoint, an OTA update server, a management channel, or a CalAmp cloud service) is not documented in the filenames, the file content, the README, or any companion document. Understanding this endpoint's purpose is relevant to security review (it represents a second data egress path from all devices configured with these scripts) and to operational documentation (a maintainer modifying the scripts would not know whether this endpoint should be preserved or whether it can be removed).

**Fix:** Document the purpose of register `2320` and the `dm.calamp.co.uk` endpoint in the register reference document recommended in finding A16-5. Clarify whether this endpoint is a CalAmp-controlled fallback (and therefore outside customer control) or a configurable parameter that should match the customer's own infrastructure.
