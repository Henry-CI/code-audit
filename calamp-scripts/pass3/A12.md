## Reading Evidence

### Directory Listing: `8bit Script/`

The directory contains exactly 2 files:

1. `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10.csv`
2. `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10 (1).csv`

With only 2 files, both are covered as the "first batch" (first half of 2). Both files were read in full.

### FILE 1: `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10.csv`

**Row count:** 328 lines total — 1 header row + 327 data rows.

**Header/comment rows:** Line 1 contains `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value` — this is the CSV column header only. There are no script-level description rows, no comment lines, and no metadata rows beyond this column header.

**Unique parameter IDs (38 total):**

| Range | IDs |
|---|---|
| Device event/reporting | 257, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 270, 271, 272, 275, 291 |
| PEG action/rule table | 512 (indices 0–121, 122 entries) |
| Comms/connection | 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774 |
| Radio/modem config | 1024 (indices 1–63) |
| GPS/positioning | 1025, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1037 |
| I/O config | 1280, 1283 |
| Input/output events | 1536, 1537, 1538, 1539, 1540 |
| Cellular/APN/server | 2306, 2307, 2311, 2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, 2316, 2318, 2319, 2320, 2322, 2327 |

**Key decoded values:**

- param 2306 (APN): hex `6461746136343130303300` → `data641003`
- param 2311 (port): hex `5014` → `20500`
- param 2314 (APN username): hex `64756D6D7900` → `dummy`
- param 2315 (APN password): hex `64756D6D7900` → `dummy`
- param 2316 (GSM dial string): hex `2A39392A2A2A312300` → `*99***1#`
- param 2318 (service code): hex `2A323238393900` → `*22899`
- param 2319 (primary server): hex `6E6172686D2E747261636B696E672D696E74656C6C6967656E63652E636F6D00` → `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com`
- param 2320 (secondary server): hex `6D61696E742E76656869636C652D6C6F636174696F6E2E636F6D00` → `maint.vehicle-location.com`
- param 769,0 (connection param): hex `2AF8` → `11000`
- param 769,1–3: hex `5014` → `20500`

**Filename component analysis:**

| Token | Interpreted Meaning |
|---|---|
| `50.131` | Version number |
| `RHM` | Author initials (Rhythm H. M. — consistent with README contact name "Rhythm Duwadi") |
| `8bit` | Unknown — not documented anywhere in the repository |
| `LMU1220` | CalAmp device model |
| `POD` | Power-On Demand mode |
| `10minSleep6hr` | 10-minute sleep interval, 6-hour cycle |
| `Input1POS` | Input 1 set to POS (position) event trigger |
| `PwrMonEvt` | Power monitor event enabled |
| `PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10` | PEG rule 0: motion event, accelerometer threshold 4, distance 500, threshold 10 |
| Customer | Not present in filename |
| SIM carrier / APN | Not present in filename |
| Country/region | Not present in filename |

### FILE 2: `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10 (1).csv`

**Row count:** 328 lines total — identical to File 1.

**Content comparison to File 1:** Byte-for-byte identical. Every `parameter_id`, `parameter_index`, and `parameter_value` row is exactly the same as File 1. The only difference between the two files is the ` (1)` suffix in the filename, which is a Windows Explorer/OS-level copy-paste artifact.

**Header/comment rows:** Same as File 1 — column header only, no descriptive content.

### Repository-Level Documentation Review

**README.md:** Present at repository root. States:
- "This Repo contains all the new scripts created for the Rayven CI transfer."
- Scripts are "divided based on country with where the script sends data to mentioned on the name along with the type of SIM the script is for."
- New scripts should have "a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'" — the word "registers" here appears to refer to a register log or tracking document, not the technical parameter registers.
- No mention of what "8bit" means, no reference to any parameter ID glossary or CalAmp register map.

**`URL & PORTS.xlsx`:** Present at repository root. Not readable as plain text. May contain server/port documentation.

**`8bit Script/` directory:** Contains no README, no companion documentation file, no glossary.

**Other script directories for comparison:** `Aus Script/`, `UK Script/`, `US Script/`, `Demo Script/` — none contain README or documentation files. The `8bit Script/` directory is unique in the repository: no other top-level script directory uses a descriptor like "8bit"; all others are named by region/country.

**CalAmp register reference:** No CalAmp LMU1220 register map or parameter reference document is present in the repository. The README implies a "registers" tracking document should exist but none was found in any directory.

## Findings

**[A12-1]** — HIGH: "8bit" script type is undefined and undocumented throughout the entire repository

**Description:** The directory is named `8bit Script/` and both filenames embed the token `8bit`. No definition of what "8bit" means in this context exists anywhere in the repository — not in the README, not in a companion file in the directory, not in any other documentation file. In the context of CalAmp LMU configuration, "8bit" could refer to a data encoding mode, a legacy protocol variant, a hardware revision, a SIM type, a reporting format (8-bit vs 16-bit register encoding), or a different application layer. Without a definition, no engineer maintaining or deploying these scripts can determine whether an "8bit" script is appropriate for a given device, how it differs from non-"8bit" scripts in the repository, or whether using an 8bit script on a device expecting a different encoding would cause silent data corruption or failed provisioning. This is a documentation gap with direct operational consequences.

**Fix:** Add a `README.md` file to the `8bit Script/` directory that defines precisely what "8bit" means (e.g., "8-bit PEG action encoding — for use with LMU1220 firmware versions X.Y and earlier that do not support 16-bit PEG opcodes"), specifies which device models and firmware versions are compatible, and explains how these scripts differ from the scripts in other directories. Update the root `README.md` to include a directory structure table mapping each script folder name to its purpose and applicable device/firmware scope.

**[A12-2]** — HIGH: Both files in the directory are byte-for-byte duplicates with no differentiation

**Description:** `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10 (1).csv` is an exact content-identical copy of `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10.csv`. The ` (1)` suffix is a Windows OS artifact from a file copy operation (e.g., "copy here" in Explorer). The duplicate was committed to the main branch. There is no documented rationale for the duplicate, no changelog between the two, and no way to determine from the filenames or file content which is authoritative. An operator could accidentally deploy the wrong file — but since they are identical, any deployment using the wrong one would produce no detectable error, making the duplication silently confusing rather than immediately harmful. The existence of an uncommitted or undifferentiated copy in the repository also suggests the file management process has no quality gate preventing accidental commits of OS copy artifacts.

**Fix:** Delete `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-POD-10minSleep6hr-Input1POS-PwrMonEvt-PEG0MotionEvtAcc4Dist500Thes10 (1).csv` from the repository. If the two files were intended to differ (e.g., different APN, different carrier, different version), give the second file a distinct, meaningful name reflecting the actual difference. Add a git pre-commit hook or CI check that detects file names matching the OS copy pattern `* (1).*`, `* (2).*` etc. and rejects the commit.

---

**[A12-3]** — MEDIUM: No customer name embedded in filename — scripts cannot be attributed to a deployment target

**Description:** Every other script in the repository encodes a customer or project name in the filename (e.g., `CI DPWORLD Telstra Final`, `Rayven CEA`, `Rayven SIE`, `Rayven Keller`). The README states scripts are "divided based on country" and the SIM type is mentioned in the name. The `8bit Script/` filenames contain no customer name, no project name, and no country/region indicator. The APN decoded from param 2306 is `data641003`, which is not a standard public carrier APN name and cannot be mapped to a customer or carrier without external knowledge. An operator maintaining or deploying these scripts cannot determine from the filename alone which customer fleet, country, or carrier these scripts are intended for.

**Fix:** Rename the file to include the customer name and carrier/APN context, following the repository convention (e.g., `50.131-RHM-8bit-LMU1220-[CustomerName]-[Carrier]-POD-10minSleep6hr-....csv`). Document the meaning of APN `data641003` in the directory README.

---

**[A12-4]** — MEDIUM: No inline documentation in any CSV file — parameter values are opaque without external reference

**Description:** Neither file contains any comment or description row beyond the column header `parameter_id,parameter_index,parameter_value`. All parameter values are raw hex integers. The 512-series PEG action table (122 entries, each 8 bytes of packed hex) encodes complex event trigger logic that is entirely unreadable without a CalAmp PEG opcode reference. The 1024-series radio/modem configuration (63 byte-indexed entries) is similarly opaque. There is no CalAmp LMU1220 register map or parameter reference document anywhere in the repository to decode these values. A technician modifying a specific behavior (e.g., changing the motion detection threshold or the sleep interval) cannot identify the correct row without reverse-engineering the hex values against an external vendor document.

**Fix:** At minimum, add a companion `registers.md` (or equivalent) to the `8bit Script/` directory mapping the parameter IDs used in these scripts to human-readable names and units (e.g., "param 265: reporting interval array in seconds; index 0 = 0x3C = 60s moving interval"). For the most critical parameters (APN/server/port, sleep timers, PEG rules), add human-readable labels as comments in the CSV if the LMU Manager tool supports a comment row format; if not, maintain the companion document alongside each script version.

---

**[A12-5]** — MEDIUM: No SIM carrier documented — APN `data641003` is unrecognized and unattributed

**Description:** The APN decoded from param 2306 is `data641003`. This is not a standard public carrier APN (compare: `telstra.internet`, `data.mono`, `kore.vodafone.com`, `iot.truphone.com`). It is not documented in the repository README, in any companion file, or in the `URL & PORTS.xlsx` file (which is a binary file not accessible to plain-text tooling). Without knowing which carrier uses this APN, it is impossible to verify that the SIM cards deployed with these scripts are compatible with this APN, or to troubleshoot connectivity failures in the field. The filename token `RHM` (author initials) and the version `50.131` do not provide any carrier context.

**Fix:** Add the carrier name to the filename following repository convention. Add a companion README in the `8bit Script/` directory identifying the carrier associated with APN `data641003`, the country of deployment, and the SIM type (prepaid/postpaid/IoT). Update `URL & PORTS.xlsx` or an equivalent plain-text document to include this APN.

---

**[A12-6]** — LOW: Version numbering scheme is not documented and no changelog exists

**Description:** The filename begins with `50.131`, which appears to be a version number following the pattern used elsewhere in the repository (e.g., `61.36`, `61.37`, `161.31`, `161.32`, `62.134`). The README states "there should be a different version name" for new scripts but does not explain what the major and minor version numbers represent (e.g., whether `50` is a country code, a script family identifier, or an arbitrary prefix, and whether `.131` is a sequential revision or encodes specific information). Without a versioning scheme definition, engineers cannot determine whether `50.131` is newer or older than `50.130` or `50.132`, cannot track the history of changes between versions, and cannot confirm whether the ` (1)` copy was intended as a version increment that was incorrectly named.

**Fix:** Document the versioning scheme in the root README or in a `VERSIONING.md`. Specify what the major number prefix represents (country? device family? platform?), what the minor number represents (sequential revision? feature encoding?), and under what circumstances a new version number should be allocated. Maintain a CHANGELOG or git tag per version.

---

**[A12-7]** — LOW: The "registers" tracking document referenced in the README does not exist in the repository

**Description:** The root README states: "For any new scripts you wish to create there should be a different version name and it should be register in the 'registers'." This implies a "registers" log or registry document where script versions are tracked. No such document was found in the repository — not as a Markdown file, not as a spreadsheet (other than `URL & PORTS.xlsx` which relates to server endpoints rather than script versions), and not as any other format. Without this registry, there is no inventory of which scripts exist, which are active/retired, which customer or device type each script is for, or who last modified each script. The two 8bit files are particularly affected: they have no customer attribution in their names and no registry entry to provide context.

**Fix:** Create and commit the script registry document referenced by the README. At minimum it should be a CSV or Markdown table with columns: filename, version, customer, country, SIM carrier, APN, device model, firmware compatibility, author, last modified date, status (active/deprecated). Include both 8bit script files in the registry.

---

**[A12-8]** — INFO: Production server hostnames are present in both 8bit scripts without customer attribution

**Description:** Param 2319 decodes to `narhm.tracking-intelligence.com` (primary server) and param 2320 to `maint.vehicle-location.com` (secondary server) — the same CI platform endpoints seen in the DPWorld AU scripts. Param 2311 (port) is `0x5014` = 20500, also matching the DPWorld AU configuration. Since the 8bit scripts contain no customer name, it cannot be determined from the files alone whether these scripts are intended for the same CI deployment as DPWorld AU, or whether the server/port values are reused across multiple unrelated customers. This is an informational observation; the security implications of the production hostname exposure were reported separately in Pass 1.

**Fix:** No immediate action beyond what was recommended in Pass 1 (A12-2 of the Pass 1 report). However, when the customer attribution finding (A12-3 above) is addressed, confirm that the server/port values are correct for the specific customer deployment these scripts serve.
